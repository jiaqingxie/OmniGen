        You are given the following spectra for a molecule:
        {spectra_list}

        Please select the most appropriate spectrum for the following task, and generate a question, choices, and answer based on it.
        In your JSON output, include a field "selected_spectrum_type" to indicate which spectrum you used.

        Please answer in the following JSON format:
        {{
          "selected_spectrum_type": "IR",
          "question": "What type of spectrum is shown in this image?",
          "choices": ["Infrared Spectrum (IR)", "Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H-NMR)", "Carbon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (C-NMR)", "Mass Spectrometry (MS)", "Raman Spectrum"],
          "answer": "Infrared Spectrum (IR)"
        }}

        Example:
        {{
          "selected_spectrum_type": "H-NMR",
          "question": "Which substructure is most likely present based on the H-NMR spectrum?",
          "choices": ["Benzene ring", "Alkene", "Alkyne", "Ether", "Alcohol"],

        You are given the following spectra for a molecule:
        {spectra_list}

        Please select the most appropriate spectrum for evaluating signal quality, and generate a question, choices, and answer based on it.
        In your JSON output, include a field "selected_spectrum_type" to indicate which spectrum you used.

        Please answer in the following JSON format:
        {{
          "selected_spectrum_type": "IR",
          "question": "Does this spectrum show obvious signal quality issues?",
          "choices": ["Yes, obvious quality issues", "No, the signal is very clear", "Localized noise", "Very low noise, negligible"],
          "answer": "No, the signal is very clear"
        }}

        Example:
        {{
          "selected_spectrum_type": "MASS",
          "question": "Does this mass spectrum show obvious signal quality issues?",
          "choices": ["Yes, obvious quality issues", "No, the signal is very clear", "Localized noise", "Very low noise, negligible"],
