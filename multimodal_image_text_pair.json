    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C22H27N3O4 (SMILES: CC(C)[C@H](C(=O)NO)N1CCN(Cc2cccc(OCc3ccccc3)c2)C1=O). The spectrum displays characteristic absorption bands corresponding to key functional groups in the molecule. A sharp peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests N-H stretching vibrations, likely from the hydroxamic acid (C(=O)NO) and urea (N1CCN...C1=O) moieties, though the absence of a broader O-H band indicates limited hydrogen bonding in this region. The prominent absorption at ~1680 cm⁻¹ is attributed to carbonyl (C=O) stretching, consistent with the urea and hydroxamic acid groups. Additional peaks at ~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1500 cm⁻¹ correspond to aromatic C=C stretching vibrations from the benzene rings in the structure. The region between 2850–2950 cm⁻¹ shows C-H stretching from aliphatic groups, including the isopropyl moiety and methylene bridges. A distinct band near 1250 cm⁻¹ aligns with C-O stretching in the aromatic ether linkage (OCc3ccccc3), while weaker absorptions at ~1050 cm⁻¹ may reflect C-N stretching in the urea or hydroxamic acid framework. The absence of peaks above 3500 cm⁻¹ or below 1000 cm⁻¹ further supports the absence of alcohols, carboxylic acids, or inorganic impurities. This spectral profile aligns with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of amide, urea, ether, and aromatic functionalities."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C19H19N3O3 (SMILES: COC(C(=O)NCc1ccc(C#N)cc1)c1ccc(NC(C)=O)cc1). The spectrum displays seven distinct proton resonances across the chemical shift range of 3.8–13.5 ppm, consistent with the structural features of the compound. The most downfield signal at 13.5 ppm (intensity ~0.07) corresponds to the amide proton (NH) of the acetamide group (-NC(C)=O), which experiences strong deshielding due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing carbonyl. A second amide proton (NH) from the -CONHCH2- moiety appears at 11.0 ppm (intensity ~0.06), slightly less deshielded due to reduced hydrogen-bonding effects. A third resonance at 10.5 ppm (intensity ~0.05) likely arises from an exchangeable proton, possibly a minor tautomeric form or solvent interaction. Aromatic protons dominate the 7.5–8.2 ppm region, with two doublets at 8.2 ppm (intensity ~0.02) and 7.5 ppm (intensity ~0.015) integrating to four protons total. These correspond to the para-substituted benzene rings: one ring bears the nitrile (-C#N) group, and the other the acetamide substituent. The nitrile’s electron-withdrawing effect deshields adjacent protons, shifting their resonance downfield. The methine proton (-CH-) adjacent to the methoxy group (-OCH3) appears as a singlet at 5.2 ppm (intensity ~0.11), reflecting its coupling to no neighboring protons. The methoxy group itself (-OCH3) resonates at 3.8 ppm (intensity ~0.22), a typical region for alkoxy methyl groups. No signals are observed for the methyl group of the acetamide (-NC(C)=O), suggesting overlap with other peaks or rapid rotation averaging its chemical environment. The spectrum’s peak intensities and splitting patterns align with the molecular symmetry and functional groups in the provided SMILES, confirming the presence of two aromatic rings, two amide linkages, a nitrile, and a methoxy group. The absence of peaks below 3 ppm indicates no aliphatic protons beyond the methoxy and methine groups. This H-NMR analysis supports the structural assignment of C19H19N3O3 as a bifunctional aromatic compound with distinct electronic environments modulated by electron-withdrawing substituents."

The spectrum displays several prominent peaks corresponding to fragment ions and the molecular ion. The most intense peak at m/z 444 represents the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 443.39 g/mol for C19H21F4N5O3. A cluster of peaks at m/z 398, 399, and 400 suggests isotopic contributions or minor fragmentation, potentially involving loss of small neutral species (e.g., HF or CO2) from the molecular ion. Key fragment ions include a significant peak at m/z 318, which may arise from cleavage of the ethoxy group (C2H5O) and adjacent bonds, retaining the trifluoromethyl (CF3) moiety. The peak at m/z 329 could correspond to a fragment retaining the pyrimidine ring (N5-containing heterocycle) and part of the aromatic system. Peaks at m/z 126 and 128 suggest smaller fragments, possibly involving the fluorinated aromatic ring or the urea linkage (NCON). The peak at m/z 70 is characteristic of a pyrrolidine-derived fragment (C4H8N), consistent with the N3CCCC3 group in the SMILES structure. The presence of multiple fluorine atoms (F4) is reflected in the isotopic patterns and fragmentation behavior, as fluorine-rich fragments often exhibit distinct mass shifts. The base peak at m/z 444 indicates high stability of the protonated molecular ion, while the relative abundances of fragment ions provide insights into the molecule’s structural features, such as the robustness of the pyrimidine ring and the lability of the ethoxy and urea linkages. This spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, confirming the molecular formula and functional group composition through diagnostic fragmentation pathways."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C9H12N2O4 (SMILES: COC(=O)C[C@@H](C)c1c(O)ncnc1O). The spectrum displays nine distinct carbon environments, consistent with the molecular formula. Key features include a prominent peak at ~170 ppm, corresponding to the ester carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the COOCH3 group, which is highly deshielded due to the electronegativity of the oxygen. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~60 ppm arises from the methoxy group (OCH3) attached to the carbonyl, reflecting its oxygen-bound environment. In the aliphatic region, a peak at ~45 ppm is attributed to the methylene carbon (CH2) adjacent to the carbonyl group, influenced by its proximity to the electron-withdrawing ester functionality. The chiral center at the methine carbon (CH) appears at ~30 ppm, while the attached methyl group (CH3) resonates at ~20 ppm, both reflecting their relatively shielded environments. The aromatic region (100–160 ppm) reveals three distinct peaks. The signals at ~155 ppm and ~150 ppm correspond to the pyrimidine ring carbons bearing hydroxyl groups (C-OH), which are strongly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the hydroxyl substituents. The peak at ~120 ppm is assigned to the ring carbon adjacent to the aliphatic substituent (C-CH(CH3)CH2COOCH3), which experiences moderate deshielding from the ring’s electron-deficient nitrogen atoms. Notably, the spectrum lacks symmetry in the aromatic region, confirming the asymmetric substitution pattern of the pyrimidine ring (4,6-dihydroxy substitution with a 5-position aliphatic chain). The absence of peaks below 20 ppm or above 170 ppm aligns with the absence of additional functional groups such as ketones or highly electronegative substituents beyond those specified. This distribution of chemical shifts and peak intensities provides a clear fingerprint of the molecule’s structural features, including the ester moiety, chiral center, and hydroxyl-substituted heteroaromatic ring."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C15H9BrN4O (SMILES: O=C1Nc2ncc(Br)cc2C1=Cc1ccc2cn[nH]c2c1). The spectrum displays several key peaks that provide insights into the molecular structure and fragmentation behavior. The most prominent peak at m/z 341 corresponds to the molecular ion (M⁺), confirming the molecular weight of 341 g/mol, consistent with the given formula. The presence of bromine is evident from the characteristic isotope pattern: a secondary peak at m/z 339 (not explicitly labeled in the spectrum but implied by the bromine isotope ratio) would arise from the ⁷⁹Br isotope, while the dominant m/z 341 peak reflects the ⁸¹Br isotope. Fragmentation peaks are observed at m/z 262, 313, 325, 143, and 131. The base peak at m/z 262 (highest relative abundance) suggests a major fragmentation pathway involving the loss of a bromine atom (Br•, 80 Da) from the molecular ion, yielding a stable fragment. The peak at m/z 313 may result from the loss of a smaller neutral fragment, such as CO (28 Da), from the molecular ion (341 - 28 = 313). Similarly, the peak at m/z 325 could correspond to the loss of a hydroxyl radical (•OH, 17 Da) or a related small fragment. Lower-mass peaks at m/z 143 and 131 likely represent structurally significant subunits. The m/z 131 fragment aligns with the indazole moiety (C₇H₅N₃, theoretical m/z 131), a component of the molecule’s right-hand aromatic system. The m/z 143 peak may arise from a fragment retaining part of the quinoline-like core (e.g., C₈H₅N₂O, accounting for the carbonyl group and adjacent rings). The spectrum’s overall fragmentation pattern reflects the molecule’s heterocyclic and halogenated nature, with bromine’s isotopic signature and the stability of aromatic fragments driving the observed peaks. These features collectively validate the proposed structure and provide a detailed view of the compound’s mass spectral behavior."

The spectrum displays four prominent peaks in the chemical shift range of 12–4 ppm, corresponding to distinct proton environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak at ~12 ppm (highest chemical shift) likely represents an aromatic proton adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups, such as the carbonyl (C=O) or chlorine substituent, which deshield the proton. A sharp peak at ~10 ppm may correspond to another deshielded aromatic proton, possibly on the pyridine ring (due to the \"n\" in the SMILES notation indicating nitrogen), where the electronegative nitrogen and chlorine further reduce electron density. The peak at ~6 ppm is characteristic of aromatic protons in a less deshielded environment, likely on the benzene ring substituted with methoxy (-OCH3) groups. The singlet at ~4 ppm aligns with the methoxy protons (-OCH3), which typically appear in the 3.5–4.5 ppm range due to shielding by oxygen. The absence of peaks below 3 ppm suggests no aliphatic protons (e.g., methyl or methylene groups) are present in distinct environments, though the molecular formula includes methyl groups (C18H20ClNO5). These may overlap with other signals or be obscured by baseline noise. The splitting patterns (not fully resolved in the image) and integration ratios would further confirm the number of protons in each environment. For instance, the three methoxy groups (three -OCH3 units) should integrate to 9H, while aromatic protons (total of 4H based on the SMILES) would account for the remaining signals. The spectrum’s features align with the proposed structure, highlighting the influence of substituents like chlorine, carbonyl, and methoxy groups on proton chemical shifts. Electron-withdrawing effects and aromatic ring currents dominate the spectral profile, providing insights into the molecule’s electronic environment."

The spectrum displays characteristic proton resonances across distinct chemical shift regions. In the aromatic region (7.0–7.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, corresponding to the protons on the two phenyl rings: one from the benzyl substituent (Cc1ccccc1) and the other from the substituted aromatic ring (c1ccc2c(c1)). These signals appear as multiplets due to complex coupling patterns typical of aromatic systems. A prominent singlet near 1.4 ppm is consistent with the tert-butyl group of the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group (N(OC(C)(C)C)), which typically appears as a sharp, high-intensity peak due to its nine equivalent protons. Adjacent to this, a triplet at ~1.0 ppm and a quartet at ~3.0 ppm likely arise from the ethyl group (CCSO2NH–), with the triplet corresponding to the terminal methyl protons and the quartet to the methylene protons adjacent to the sulfonyl group. The sulfonyl group deshields the nearby CH2, shifting its resonance downfield. In the aliphatic region (2–4 ppm), additional peaks are observed, including a multiplet near 2.5 ppm, which may correspond to the methylene protons of the benzyl group (CH2–Ph) and the CH2 groups in the tetralin-like core (CC2). The Boc-protected amine’s adjacent CH proton (C(NBoc)CH) is expected around 4.0–4.5 ppm, potentially overlapping with the NH proton of the sulfonamide (SO2NH), which often appears as a broad singlet in this region. The spectrum’s baseline resolution and peak distribution align with the molecular structure, reflecting the presence of aromatic, aliphatic, and functional group-specific protons. The absence of signals above 8 ppm suggests no strongly deshielded protons (e.g., aldehydic or carboxylic protons), consistent with the given formula. Overall, the observed chemical shifts and splitting patterns provide a clear fingerprint of the molecule’s structural features."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at ~170 ppm corresponds to the ester carbonyl carbon (C=O), which is highly deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen and resonance effects. A cluster of peaks between 140–110 ppm arises from aromatic carbons in the furan and imidazole rings. Specifically, the furan ring’s α- and β-carbons to the oxygen atom typically resonate in this region, while the imidazole ring’s carbons (particularly those adjacent to nitrogen atoms) contribute to the multiplicity of signals. A sharp peak near 60 ppm is attributed to the methylene carbon (OCH2) of the ethyl ester group, deshielded by the adjacent oxygen. Another peak at ~55 ppm likely corresponds to the CH2 group linking the furan and imidazole rings, influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of the heterocycles. The hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) on the imidazole ring appears as a distinct signal near 60–65 ppm, slightly upfield due to the inductive effect of the hydroxyl group. In the aliphatic region (0–40 ppm), a peak at ~20 ppm is assigned to the terminal methyl group (CH3) of the ethyl ester, while a less intense signal at ~30 ppm may correspond to the imidazole ring’s carbon adjacent to two nitrogen atoms (e.g., C-2 in the imidazole), which is deshielded but still within the aliphatic range. The absence of signals below 10 ppm confirms no isolated aliphatic chains are present. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s heterocyclic and functional group diversity, with each carbon environment distinctly resolved. The integration of peak positions aligns with the structural features of CCOC(=O)c1ccc(Cn2cncc2CO)o1, including the ester, furan, imidazole, and hydroxymethyl moieties. This analysis underscores the utility of C-NMR in elucidating molecular frameworks through characteristic chemical shift ranges and peak multiplicities."

The spectrum exhibits several key features characteristic of its molecular structure. A sharp, moderate-intensity peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to aromatic C-H stretching vibrations, consistent with the substituted benzene ring in the molecule. The broad, intense absorption around 2950 cm⁻¹ arises from asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching in the aliphatic hexyl chain and tert-butyl groups. A distinct peak at 1600 cm⁻¹ is attributed to C=C stretching in the aromatic ring, while weaker bands near 1450 cm⁻¹ and 1375 cm⁻¹ reflect C-H bending vibrations in the alkyl substituents. Notably, a very strong, sharp peak at 800 cm⁻¹ is indicative of C-Br stretching, confirming the presence of the bromine atom. The absence of broad O-H or N-H stretches above 3000 cm⁻¹ aligns with the lack of hydroxyl or amine functional groups. The spectrum also shows minimal absorption in the 1700–2200 cm⁻¹ region, ruling out carbonyl or triple-bond functionalities. These features collectively support the assigned structure, with the aromatic ring, alkyl chains, and bromine substitution clearly reflected in the vibrational modes."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak appears near 200 ppm, corresponding to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the acetyl group (–COCH3), which typically resonates in the 190–220 ppm range due to the deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen atom. Adjacent to this, a cluster of peaks between 130–140 ppm arises from the aromatic carbons in the two benzene rings. These shifts are consistent with substituted aromatic systems, where electron-withdrawing or donating groups (e.g., the thioether –S– linkage and methyl substituents) alter the local magnetic environment. Additional peaks in the 120–130 ppm region likely correspond to the aromatic carbons directly bonded to the sulfur atom or methyl groups, as these substituents induce moderate upfield shifts compared to unsubstituted benzene. The methyl groups (–CH3) attached to the aromatic rings produce signals in the 20–30 ppm range, with slight variations due to their distinct positions on the benzene rings. The intensity of these peaks reflects the number of equivalent carbons: the carbonyl carbon (1C) and the methyl groups (3C each) exhibit lower intensities compared to the aromatic carbons (10C total), which appear as overlapping signals due to their similar chemical environments. The absence of peaks below 10 ppm indicates no aliphatic quaternary carbons or highly shielded environments. The overall spectral pattern aligns with the molecular structure, where the acetyl group, substituted aromatic rings, and thioether linkage create a diverse array of carbon environments. This C-NMR spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule’s structural features, including the presence of a ketone, aromatic systems, and methyl substituents, all consistent with the formula C17H18OS."

Additional significant peaks at m/z 315, 316, and 317 suggest further fragmentation of this intermediate, potentially involving loss of the fluorine-substituted aromatic ring or rearrangement. The peak at m/z 91 is characteristic of the tropylium ion (C7H7+), a common fragment from the benzyl group (Cc1ccccc1) in the structure. Peaks at m/z 118 and 127 may correspond to smaller aromatic or heterocyclic fragments, such as the pyrrolidine-urea unit (N3CCCC3) or substituted pyridine derivatives. The signal at m/z 208 could indicate a fragment retaining the central ether-linked aromatic system (Oc2ccnc...).

The most prominent peak at approximately 170 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon of the lactone ring, a characteristic downfield shift due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent oxygen atoms. Aromatic carbons appear between 120–160 ppm, with the methoxy-substituted aromatic carbons (C2 and C6 in the benzene ring) likely contributing to the signals near 150–160 ppm, reflecting deshielding from the electron-donating methoxy group. Additional aromatic carbons (C3, C4, and C5) are observed in the 120–140 ppm range, with slight splitting due to substituent effects. A sharp peak near 100 ppm may correspond to the quaternary carbon (C1) in the benzene ring, which is directly bonded to the lactone oxygen. The aliphatic region (0–60 ppm) shows multiple resonances: the cyclohexyl ring carbons (C1'–C6') appear as a cluster of peaks between 20–40 ppm, with the methylene groups (e.g., C2' and C6') likely contributing to the higher-intensity signals around 30 ppm.

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H10O3 (SMILES: COc1ccc2cc(C(C)=O)oc2c1). The spectrum exhibits characteristic features of a benzofuran derivative with methoxy and acetyl substituents. Key observations include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6.5–8.5 ppm):** Multiple peaks in this range correspond to the five aromatic protons of the fused benzofuran system. The benzene ring (substituted with a methoxy group) and the furan ring (substituted with an acetyl group) generate distinct chemical environments. The protons ortho to the methoxy group on the benzene ring appear as a doublet near 7.2 ppm (integration ~1H), while the para proton to the methoxy group appears as a singlet or doublet around 6.8 ppm (~1H). The furan ring protons exhibit signals near 7.5 ppm (doublet, ~1H, adjacent to the acetyl group) and 6.5 ppm (doublet, ~1H, adjacent to the oxygen), reflecting the electron-withdrawing effects of the acetyl group and the oxygen heteroatom. 2. **Methoxy Group (~3.9 ppm):** A sharp singlet at 3.9 ppm integrates to 3H, confirming the presence of the methoxy (-OCH3) substituent on the benzene ring. 3. **Acetyl Methyl Group (~2.5 ppm):** A singlet at 2.5 ppm integrates to 3H, corresponding to the methyl group of the acetyl (-COCH3) moiety. This signal is deshielded due to the adjacent carbonyl group. 4. **Absence of Aldehyde/Carboxylic Protons:** No peaks are observed below 6 ppm or above 10 ppm, ruling out aldehyde (-CHO) or carboxylic acid (-COOH) functionalities. The integration ratios (3H:3H:5H) align with the molecular structure, and the splitting patterns reflect the coupling between aromatic protons. The spectrum confirms the substitution pattern of the benzofuran core, with the methoxy group activating the benzene ring and the acetyl group influencing the electronic environment of the furan ring. These features are consistent with the provided SMILES notation and molecular formula."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecular structure. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (110–160 ppm):** - A prominent peak at ~155 ppm corresponds to the quaternary aromatic carbon bonded to the methoxy group (OCH3) on the benzene ring. - Peaks at ~145 ppm and ~130 ppm are assigned to aromatic carbons adjacent to nitrogen in the pyrimidine ring (ncnc), reflecting deshielding due to electronegative substituents. - Additional peaks at ~120 ppm and ~115 ppm represent aromatic carbons in the benzene ring, with slight shifts due to methoxy and pyrimidine substituents. 2. **Carbonyl/Carbonyl-like Region (160–180 ppm):** - A sharp, high-intensity peak at ~170 ppm indicates the presence of a carbonyl carbon, likely from the ester or amide functional group in the molecule. 3. **Aliphatic/Oxygenated Region (50–100 ppm):** - A peak at ~60 ppm corresponds to the methoxy carbons (OCH3) attached to the benzene ring. - Peaks at ~55 ppm and ~45 ppm are attributed to the oxygenated aliphatic carbons in the morpholine-like ring (CCOC3(C)C), with deshielding from the adjacent oxygen atom. 4. **Methyl Region (0–30 ppm):** - A peak at ~25 ppm represents the methyl groups (C(CH3)2) in the morpholine ring, showing typical upfield shifts for aliphatic carbons. - A smaller peak at ~10 ppm may correspond to a terminal methyl group or residual solvent signal. The spectrum’s peak distribution aligns with the molecular structure, where methoxy groups, aromatic systems, and aliphatic carbons contribute to distinct chemical environments. The absence of peaks above 180 ppm suggests no aldehyde or ketone carbonyls are present. Overall, the C-NMR data supports the proposed structure, with clear differentiation between aromatic, oxygenated, and aliphatic carbons."

The spectrum displays a dominant molecular ion peak at m/z 353, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 352.38 g/mol. A significant fragment ion at m/z 311 suggests the loss of a 42 Da fragment, likely attributed to the cleavage of the isopropyl group (C3H5) from the n(C(C)C) moiety in the quinazolinone ring system. Additional prominent peaks at m/z 279 and 252 indicate sequential losses of methoxy (CH3O, 31 Da) and carbonyl (CO, 28 Da) groups, respectively, from the molecular ion. The peak at m/z 237 may arise from the elimination of a 115 Da fragment, potentially representing the methoxyphenyl substituent (-c3cccc(OC)c3) attached to the quinazolinone core. Further fragmentation at m/z 210 and 196 suggests cleavage of the ester group (COOCH3, 59 Da) and adjacent bonds, yielding stable aromatic fragments. The base peak at m/z 134 corresponds to a highly stable benzoxazole or benzimidazole-like fragment, characteristic of the heterocyclic core structure. Smaller peaks at m/z 297 and 321 could represent adducts or isotopic variants, while the absence of significant peaks below m/z 100 confirms the stability of the aromatic and heterocyclic components under ionization. These fragmentation patterns are consistent with the proposed structure, where the quinazolinone ring, methoxy substituents, and isopropyl group contribute to the observed mass transitions. The spectrum highlights the molecule's susceptibility to cleavage at alkyl and ester linkages, while retaining the integrity of its aromatic systems. This analysis underscores the utility of mass spectrometry in elucidating structural features of heterocyclic compounds with multiple functional groups."

The spectrum exhibits several key features consistent with the functional groups present in this structure. A prominent, sharp absorption band near 1700 cm⁻¹ is observed, which is characteristic of carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibrations. This peak likely corresponds to the combined contributions of the ketone group (C=O in the six-membered ring) and the ester carbonyl (from the tert-butoxycarbonyl group attached to nitrogen). The absence of broad absorption in the 3200–3600 cm⁻¹ region confirms the lack of hydroxyl (O-H) or amine (N-H) groups, aligning with the molecular structure. Additional peaks in the 1000–1300 cm⁻¹ range reflect C-O stretching vibrations, likely from the ester (C-O-C) and the cyclic ether (tetrahydrofuran ring) components of the molecule. These bands are typically strong and complex due to the coupling of vibrational modes in oxygen-containing functional groups. The region below 1500 cm⁻¹ (fingerprint region) displays multiple smaller peaks, which arise from a combination of C-C, C-O, and C-N bond deformations, as well as ring vibrations from the heterocyclic and carbocyclic systems. The spectrum also shows weak absorptions near 2950 cm⁻¹, attributed to C-H stretching in aliphatic (sp³-hybridized) carbon atoms, including those in the tert-butyl group and the saturated rings. No significant peaks are observed in the 2100–2260 cm⁻¹ region, ruling out the presence of nitrile (C≡N) or alkyne (C≡C) groups. The overall spectral profile supports the structural assignment, with the dominant carbonyl and C-O features serving as diagnostic markers for the molecule’s ketone, ester, and ether functionalities. This IR spectrum provides clear evidence of the compound’s functional group composition and corroborates the proposed molecular framework."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C14H15NO2 (SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(CNc2ccccc2)c1). The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides a two-dimensional correlation between the chemical shifts of directly bonded $^1$H and $^{13}$C nuclei. In this spectrum, the $^1$H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans from ~14 ppm to -2 ppm, while the $^{13}$C chemical shift axis (y-axis) ranges from ~200 ppm to 0 ppm. The cross-peaks (black dots) represent pairs of $^1$H and $^{13}$C nuclei that are directly bonded, enabling the assignment of proton signals to specific carbon atoms in the molecule. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic region (6–8 ppm in $^1$H, 100–160 ppm in $^{13}$C):** Multiple cross-peaks are observed here, consistent with the two aromatic rings in the molecule. The substituted benzene ring (attached to the methoxy and hydroxyl groups) and the phenyl group of the benzylamine moiety contribute to these signals. The spread of $^{13}$C shifts (100–160 ppm) reflects the electron-withdrawing effects of oxygen substituents (e.g., -OCH3 and -OH), which deshield adjacent carbons. 2. **Methoxy group (3.5–4 ppm in $^1$H, ~55 ppm in $^{13}$C):** A distinct cross-peak is visible near 3.8 ppm ($^1$H) and 55 ppm ($^{13}$C), corresponding to the -OCH3 group. The upfield $^1$H shift and moderate $^{13}$C shift are characteristic of a methoxy carbon bonded to an aromatic ring. 3. **Benzylamine CH2 group (3–4 ppm in $^1$H, ~50 ppm in $^{13}$C):** A cross-peak near 3.5 ppm ($^1$H) and 50 ppm ($^{13}$C) indicates the -CH2- group in the benzylamine (-CH2NH-) moiety. The $^1$H shift is slightly downfield due to the adjacent nitrogen atom. 4. **Oxygenated aromatic carbons (~150–160 ppm in $^{13}$C):** Cross-peaks in this region correlate with protons on the aromatic ring bearing the -OH and -OCH3 groups. The high $^{13}$C shifts reflect the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen substituents. The absence of cross-peaks in the carbonyl region (160–220 ppm in $^{13}$C) confirms the lack of carbonyl groups in the molecule, consistent with the provided formula and SMILES. The HSQC data effectively maps the proton-carbon connectivity, supporting the structural assignment of the molecule as a methoxy-substituted benzylamine derivative. This analysis highlights the utility of HSQC in resolving complex aromatic systems and identifying key functional groups through direct heteronuclear correlations."

The most downfield proton resonance appears at ~12 ppm, paired with a 13C shift of ~160 ppm, likely corresponding to a deshielded aromatic or heteroaromatic proton adjacent to electronegative substituents. A second peak at ~6 ppm (1H) and ~50 ppm (13C) suggests a methine (CH) group in a moderately electron-withdrawing environment, possibly near the pyridine nitrogen or ester functionalities. The cross-peak at ~4 ppm (1H) and ~30 ppm (13C) may represent a methylene (CH2) group, though its carbon shift is unusually low for an oxygen-adjacent carbon; this could indicate partial overlap with other signals or solvent effects. Finally, the upfield peak at ~3 ppm (1H) and ~20 ppm (13C) aligns with a methyl (CH3) group, likely one of the two methyl substituents on the pyridine ring. The absence of additional peaks suggests either overlapping signals or limited resolution in regions with crowded chemical shifts.

The most downfield peak, located near 140 ppm, corresponds to the carbon directly bonded to the bromine atom (C-Br). This significant downfield shift is characteristic of a carbon deshielded by the electronegative bromine substituent. Two additional peaks in the aromatic region (approximately 120 ppm and 130 ppm) arise from the sp2-hybridized carbons in the imidazole ring, which experience moderate deshielding due to the ring's conjugated π-system and proximity to nitrogen atoms. The fourth peak, appearing near 0 ppm, is attributed to the methyl group (C-CH3) attached to the ring carbon. This upfield position reflects the shielding effect typical of aliphatic methyl groups. The absence of a fifth peak suggests that the nitrogen-bound methyl group (N-CH3) either overlaps with another signal or is not resolved under the experimental conditions, potentially due to rapid rotation or symmetry in the molecular structure. The observed chemical shifts and peak intensities align with the expected electronic environments in a 2-bromo-1,5-dimethylimidazole framework, where the bromine and nitrogen atoms influence the ring's electronic distribution, and the methyl groups contribute distinct aliphatic signatures."

A cluster of peaks between 140–160 ppm likely represents aromatic carbons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing chlorine substituent and the pyrrole nitrogen, which induce significant deshielding. Peaks in the 110–130 ppm range are attributed to unsubstituted aromatic carbons in the benzene and pyrrole rings, with the pyrrole ring carbons (particularly the sp²-hybridized ones) contributing to this region. A distinct peak at ~60 ppm aligns with the CH₂ group of the cyclopropylmethanol moiety (C4(CO)CC4), where the oxygen atom deshields the adjacent carbon. The cyclopropane ring carbons appear as a peak near 30 ppm, consistent with their sp³-hybridized, strained environment. Additional minor peaks in the 20–40 ppm range may arise from overlapping signals of aliphatic carbons in the cyclopropane ring or slight conformational variations.

The spectrum displays several key peaks that provide insights into the molecular structure and fragmentation behavior of the compound. The most prominent feature is the base peak at m/z 149, which represents the most abundant fragment ion. This peak likely arises from a stable fragment retaining significant structural integrity, possibly due to the loss of a neutral acetyl group (C2H2O, 42 Da) from the molecular ion, yielding a fragment with the formula C10H10N2O (calculated m/z: 174 - 42 = 132; the observed 149 suggests additional rearrangement or protonation effects). The molecular ion peak ([M+H]+) is observed at m/z 217, corresponding to the protonated molecular weight of C12H12N2O2 (216 Da + 1 Da for the proton). The presence of this peak confirms the molecular formula. A smaller peak at m/z 150, adjacent to the base peak, may indicate isotope contributions (e.g., 13C or 15N) or a related fragment. Other notable peaks include m/z 91 and 105, which are characteristic of benzyl-type fragments. The m/z 91 peak is consistent with a tropylium ion (C7H7+), a common fragment in aromatic systems, likely originating from the benzyl group attached to the imidazole ring. The m/z 105 peak may represent a substituted benzyl fragment, such as C8H9+ (e.g., from the loss of a hydroxyl group or rearrangement). The peaks at m/z 131, 133, and 133 suggest the presence of halogen-like isotope patterns, though the molecular formula lacks halogens. These may instead arise from complex fragmentations involving the imidazole ring and adjacent substituents. For instance, cleavage of the C–O bond in the acetyl group could generate a fragment retaining the imidazole and phenolic moiety. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 217 confirms the molecular weight, while the distribution of lower-mass fragments aligns with the structural features of CC(=O)c1cc(Cn2ccnc2)ccc1O. The hydroxyl and acetyl groups contribute to fragmentation pathways involving neutral losses (e.g., CO, H2O), though these are not explicitly resolved here. The imidazole ring likely stabilizes certain fragments through resonance, enhancing their abundance. Overall, the spectrum reflects the compound’s aromatic and heterocyclic framework, with fragmentation dominated by cleavage of the acetyl and benzyl groups, as well as the inherent stability of the imidazole-containing fragments. These observations are consistent with the assigned molecular structure and provide a foundation for further structural elucidation."

The absence of signals above 14 ppm or below 0 ppm confirms the absence of highly acidic protons (e.g., aldehydic or strongly hydrogen-bonded species) or shielded environments (e.g., methyl groups in electron-rich regions). The integration ratios (not shown) would further validate the 1:1:2:8 proton distribution for the COOH, NH, CH₂, and aromatic protons, respectively. This spectrum aligns with the molecular formula and SMILES, highlighting the influence of nitro and sulfonyl groups on chemical shifts and providing insight into the compound’s electronic environment."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 369, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. The base peak at m/z 97 represents the most abundant fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the amide bond, yielding a thiophene-ethylamine fragment (C4H4NS+). Adjacent peaks at m/z 98 and 196 suggest isotopic contributions from sulfur-34 and combinations of bromine/chlorine isotopes, respectively. Key fragments include m/z 228 and 230, which exhibit a ~1:1 intensity ratio characteristic of bromine-containing species (79Br/81Br), consistent with the indole core retaining bromine. Peaks at m/z 255, 256, and 257 display a 3:1:3 pattern indicative of chlorine isotopes (35Cl/37Cl) in fragments containing both chlorine and bromine. The m/z 178 peak likely corresponds to a dehydrogenated indole derivative, while m/z 151 and 152 may represent smaller aromatic fragments retaining chlorine. Additional signals at m/z 207, 273, and 285 suggest further structural breakdown, including possible loss of hydrogen sulfide or halogen atoms. The spectrum reflects the compound’s structural complexity, with fragmentation patterns aligning to the indole-thiophene scaffold and the presence of heavy halogens (Br, Cl) producing distinct isotopic signatures. These features collectively confirm the molecular identity and provide insights into its fragmentation pathways."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 408, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 407.83 g/mol for the given formula. The base peak (100% relative abundance) at m/z 408 confirms the molecular identity. Several significant fragment ions are observed, including peaks at m/z 393, 378, 362, 358, 341, and 278. The peak at m/z 393 suggests a loss of 15 Da (likely a methyl group, -CH3), while the m/z 378 peak corresponds to a loss of 30 Da (potentially a methoxy group, -OCH3, or a combination of small neutral fragments). The m/z 362 peak indicates further fragmentation, possibly involving the nitrile group (-C#N, 27 Da loss) or aromatic ring cleavage. The presence of chlorine is evident from the characteristic isotopic pattern: peaks at m/z 358 and 360 exhibit a ~3:1 intensity ratio, consistent with the 35Cl and 37Cl isotopes. Similarly, fluorine’s monoisotopic nature (19F) contributes to sharp, single-peak signals. The fragment at m/z 278 likely arises from cleavage of the central heterocyclic ring system, retaining the chlorinated aniline moiety. Additional peaks at m/z 341 and 342 may result from partial degradation of the quinoline-like core structure. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 250 suggests stable aromatic and heterocyclic components resist further fragmentation under the ionization conditions. This fragmentation pattern reflects the molecule’s structural complexity, with methoxy groups, a nitrile substituent, and halogenated aromatic rings contributing to distinct mass losses. The spectrum’s high-resolution features provide critical insights into the molecule’s stability and fragmentation pathways, consistent with its assigned structure."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks that correlate with the structural features of the molecule. The most prominent signals appear at approximately 10.5 ppm, 4.0 ppm, 2.5 ppm, and 6.5 ppm, along with several smaller peaks in the aliphatic region (0.9–2.3 ppm). The singlet at **10.5 ppm** (1H) likely corresponds to the amide proton (NH) in the N[C@H](CC3CC3)C(N)=O moiety. This downfield shift is characteristic of hydrogen-bonded amide protons, which experience strong deshielding due to electronegative substituents and resonance effects. A sharp singlet at **4.0 ppm** (1H) is attributed to the methine proton (CH) adjacent to the amide and amine groups. This proton is deshielded by the electron-withdrawing effects of the neighboring nitrogen atoms and the carbonyl group. The singlet at **2.5 ppm** (3H) arises from the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the thiazole ring (sn1 in SMILES). Methyl groups on aromatic heterocycles typically resonate in this region due to ring current effects and inductive deshielding. Aromatic protons are observed near **6.5–7.5 ppm**. The peak at **6.5 ppm** (doublet, 1H) likely corresponds to a proton on the benzene ring ortho to the fluorine substituent. Fluorine’s strong electronegativity and spin-spin coupling (¹⁹F-¹H, J ≈ 10–15 Hz) split this signal into a doublet. Additional aromatic protons on the thiazole and benzene rings may overlap in this region, though their exact assignments require further analysis. In the aliphatic region, multiplets at **0.9–2.3 ppm** (total integration ~5H) are assigned to the cyclopropyl group (CC3CC3) and the adjacent methine proton. Cyclopropane protons typically appear upfield (0.5–1.5 ppm) due to ring strain, while the CH₂ groups may exhibit complex splitting patterns from vicinal coupling. The absence of signals below 0 ppm and above 12 ppm confirms the molecule lacks highly acidic protons (e.g., carboxylic acids) or strongly deshielded environments beyond the observed amide and aromatic systems. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting key functional groups and their electronic environments."

The spectrum displays four distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, reflecting the proton environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at **6.0 ppm** (highest intensity) corresponds to the five aromatic protons of the monosubstituted benzene ring. These protons exhibit a slightly upfield shift compared to typical aromatic regions (6.5–8.0 ppm), likely due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbamimidoyl group (N=C(NC#N)), which deshields the ring but may also induce partial conjugation effects. A secondary peak at **6.8 ppm** is attributed to the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the ester carbonyl and the nitrogen atom. This shift is moderately downfield, consistent with the deshielding influence of the electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms in proximity. The singlet at **10.1 ppm** represents the NH proton of the carbamimidoyl group, which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing cyano group (C#N). A smaller peak at **11.2 ppm** may arise from a minor tautomeric form or an exchangeable proton, such as a transient NH species stabilized by intramolecular interactions. Notably absent are peaks corresponding to the ester methyl group (expected ~3.6–3.8 ppm), suggesting either overlap with baseline noise, solvent suppression, or rapid rotational averaging in this region. The spectrum’s simplicity (few peaks) aligns with the molecule’s symmetry and the dominance of aromatic and NH environments.

The m/z 311 peak (355–44) may arise from cleavage of the pyrazole ring (C3H3N2, 81 Da) with additional rearrangement. The m/z 254 (355–101) and 244 (355–111) peaks indicate fragmentation of the quinoline core (c2nc...cc3ccccc23), potentially involving loss of the aniline-derived substituent.

The m/z 192 (209–17) suggests loss of ammonia (NH3) from the pyrazole-amine group. The m/z 143 peak aligns with the trifluoromethylphenyl fragment (C7H4F3, 143 Da), confirming the presence of the CF3-substituted benzene ring. These fragmentation patterns reflect the molecule’s structural motifs: the CF3 group, aromatic systems, and heterocyclic rings. The spectrum’s complexity underscores the stability of aromatic and heteroaromatic fragments under ionization, with the base peak at m/z 355 providing definitive evidence for the molecular ion.

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C13H12OS (SMILES: Oc1ccccc1CSc1ccccc1). The HSQC spectrum correlates directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing distinct clusters of cross-peaks that correspond to the molecular structure. The spectrum displays three primary regions of interest: 1. **Aromatic Region (6.5–7.5 ppm ¹H, 120–140 ppm ¹³C):** The dense cluster of peaks in this region corresponds to the aromatic protons and carbons of the two benzene rings. The molecule contains a phenol ring (with an -OH group) and a thioether-substituted benzene ring (-S-CH₂-). The ¹H shifts in the 6.5–7.5 ppm range are typical for aromatic protons, while the ¹³C shifts between 120–140 ppm align with sp²-hybridized aromatic carbons. Substituent effects explain the distribution: the electron-withdrawing -OH group deshields adjacent protons on the phenol ring, shifting them slightly downfield, while the sulfur atom inductively affects the other ring’s protons. 2. **Phenolic/Oxygen-Adjacent Protons (10–12 ppm ¹H, 120–140 ppm ¹³C):** A distinct set of peaks at higher ¹H shifts (10–12 ppm) likely arises from aromatic protons ortho to the hydroxyl group on the phenol ring. These protons experience strong deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing -OH, pushing their chemical shifts into the downfield region. The corresponding ¹³C shifts remain within the aromatic range, confirming their sp² hybridization. 3. **Thioether Methylene Group (2.0–2.5 ppm ¹H, ~50 ppm ¹³C):** A single cross-peak at ~2.2 ppm (¹H) and ~50 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the -CH₂- group bridging the two aromatic rings via sulfur. The ¹³C shift at ~50 ppm is characteristic of a methylene carbon adjacent to sulfur, which deshields the carbon. The ¹H shift at ~2.2 ppm reflects the electron-withdrawing influence of the sulfur atom, though less pronounced than in carbonyl-adjacent protons. The absence of peaks outside these regions confirms no aliphatic or non-aromatic protons (e.g., hydroxyl or other substituents) are detected in HSQC, as expected. The spectrum effectively maps the molecule’s protonated carbons, highlighting the aromatic framework and the thioether linkage. These features align with the structure of 2-(phenylthio)methylphenol, where the two aromatic systems and their substituents dominate the spectral profile."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H10ClFO (SMILES: C=CC1(Cl)CCOc2cc(F)ccc21). The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances consistent with the structural features of the compound. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.0 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, including a prominent doublet near 7.2 ppm and a triplet at ~6.9 ppm. These signals correspond to the fluorinated benzene ring protons, where the fluorine substituent induces deshielding and spin-spin coupling, splitting the aromatic signals into characteristic multiplets. The doublet likely arises from the ortho-proton to fluorine, while the triplet may reflect meta- or para-proton coupling. A sharp singlet at ~6.0 ppm is attributed to the vinylic proton (C=CH), deshielded by the adjacent chlorine atom and the electron-withdrawing effects of the heterocyclic oxygen. The chlorine substituent on the same carbon further shifts this signal downfield compared to typical alkenyl protons. In the aliphatic region (2.0–4.5 ppm), two distinct multiplets are visible: one near 4.2 ppm (O-CH2) and another at ~3.5 ppm (Cl-CH2). These arise from the methylene groups in the tetrahydrofuran-like ring, with the oxygenated CH2 experiencing greater deshielding. The splitting patterns suggest coupling with neighboring protons, consistent with the ring’s conformational rigidity. A minor triplet at ~1.8 ppm may correspond to the terminal CH3 group of the ethyl side chain, though its low intensity suggests partial overlap or rapid relaxation effects. The absence of signals below 1.5 ppm confirms the lack of additional aliphatic substituents. Integration ratios align with the molecular formula, showing relative intensities of aromatic (4H), vinylic (1H), and aliphatic (4H) protons. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the interplay of electronegative substituents (Cl, F, O) and the molecule’s rigid bicyclic framework, which restricts conformational averaging and preserves distinct proton environments. This analysis underscores the utility of H-NMR in resolving structural nuances in halogenated heterocycles."

A second intense peak at ~10 ppm may represent an aromatic proton on the benzene ring ortho to the electron-withdrawing amide group (O=C1), which induces significant downfield shifting. Between 6–7 ppm, a multiplet pattern is observed, consistent with protons on the benzene ring (c2ccccc2) and the pyridine ring (c2ccncc2), which typically resonate in this region due to their aromatic nature.

A broad, moderately intense peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the N–H stretching vibration of the amide group (c(=O)[nH]), indicating hydrogen bonding interactions. Sharp, strong absorption at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching of the amide moiety, consistent with its conjugation to the aromatic system. In the fingerprint region (1500–500 cm⁻¹), multiple peaks arise from complex vibrations of the aromatic rings, heterocyclic components, and aliphatic chains. Peaks near 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1500 cm⁻¹ are assignable to C=C stretching in the benzene and pyridine rings, while a sharp band at ~1450 cm⁻¹ likely reflects C–N stretching in the piperazine ring (N4CCN).

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, characteristic of aromatic and aliphatic protons in this complex structure. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at ~4.0 ppm, which corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups attached to the dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) substituent. This downfield shift relative to typical aliphatic protons (which usually appear near 0.9–1.5 ppm) reflects the electron-withdrawing influence of the adjacent nitrogen atom and the aromatic system. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), multiple overlapping peaks are observed, reflecting the protons on the substituted phenyl and pyridine rings. The fluorinated phenyl rings (-c3ccc(F)cc3 and -c3ccc(F)cc3) contribute to complex splitting patterns due to coupling between aromatic protons and the electronegative fluorine atoms (¹⁹F-¹H coupling). These interactions typically produce doublets or multiplets with coupling constants (J values) in the range of 5–10 Hz. The central pyridine ring (-nc(-c3ccc(F)cc3)c2) also contributes to this region, with protons adjacent to the nitrogen atom experiencing deshielding and appearing at slightly higher ppm values (closer to 8–9 ppm). A notable singlet at ~10.0 ppm may arise from a proton in a highly deshielded environment, potentially on the pyridine ring near the nitrogen atom, though such a high shift is atypical for pyridine derivatives and could suggest minor impurities or solvent effects. A weaker peak near 12.0 ppm is likely an artifact or baseline noise, as no protons in the molecular structure are expected in this extreme downfield region. The absence of broad peaks in the 1–2 ppm range confirms the lack of aliphatic protons beyond the dimethylamino group, consistent with the molecular formula. Integration of peak areas (not shown here) would further validate the 2:1 ratio of methyl protons to aromatic protons. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the influence of aromaticity, electronegative substituents, and heteroatoms on chemical shift dispersion."

The ester groups are symmetrically equivalent, leading to a single peak for their carbonyls, while the amide carbonyl appears slightly downfield due to its distinct electronic environment. A strong peak at ~60 ppm corresponds to the methylene carbons (OCH2) adjacent to the ester oxygens, which are deshielded by the electronegative oxygen.

The most prominent absorption occurs near 3300 cm⁻¹, corresponding to the C-H stretching vibrations of the alkene (C=C) group. This peak is slightly shifted to higher wavenumbers compared to typical alkenes, likely due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom in the ether linkage. Additional sharp peaks in the 2900–2800 cm⁻¹ region arise from C-H stretching modes of the sp³-hybridized methylene (CH₂) and methyl (CH₃) groups in the butyl and ethoxy substituents. A moderate absorption near 1650 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the C=C stretching vibration of the double bond, consistent with the enol ether functionality. This band is slightly lower in wavenumber than a typical isolated alkene due to conjugation with the oxygen's lone pairs. The strong, broad peak around 1100 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C-O-C asymmetric stretching vibration, a hallmark of ether compounds. Additional fine structure in the 1450–1375 cm⁻¹ region reflects bending vibrations of C-H bonds in the alkyl chains. The absence of a broad absorption near 3400 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of O-H groups (e.g., alcohols or carboxylic acids), while the lack of a sharp peak near 1700 cm⁻¹ rules out carbonyl (C=O) functionalities. The spectral features collectively align with the molecular structure of ethyl butyl vinyl ether (C=C(CCCC)OCC), where the enol ether group and alkyl chains dominate the IR signature. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains complex, overlapping bands from C-C stretching and C-H bending modes, further supporting the assigned structure."

The spectrum displays multiple distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of the 18 carbon atoms in the molecule. The most downfield peak, observed near 150 ppm, corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ester functional group, which is strongly deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen atom. Adjacent to this, peaks in the 130–140 ppm region are attributed to aromatic carbons in the substituted benzene and pyridine rings, with additional splitting caused by the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine and nitrile substituents. A prominent peak near 120 ppm likely represents the nitrile carbon (C#N), which is characteristically shifted downfield due to the triple bond’s strong deshielding effect. The alkyne carbons (C#C) appear as two distinct peaks around 85–90 ppm, reflecting their sp-hybridized nature and coupling with adjacent aromatic systems. The ethoxy group’s CH2 moiety is observed near 60 ppm, while the methyl substituent on the benzene ring resonates at approximately 20 ppm, both in the aliphatic region. Notably, the tallest peak at ~50 ppm may correspond to the ethoxy CH2, though its exact position suggests slight deshielding, possibly due to proximity to the ester oxygen. The spectrum also shows minor peaks in the 100–120 ppm range, which could arise from quaternary carbons in the aromatic rings or overlapping signals from the alkyne and nitrile environments. Overall, the distribution of peaks aligns with the molecular structure, where the ester, nitrile, alkyne, and halogenated aromatic systems create distinct chemical shifts. The absence of peaks above 160 ppm confirms the lack of additional carbonyl groups, while the resolution of 10–12 distinct signals (despite 18 carbons) suggests symmetry or overlapping environments in certain regions. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the molecule’s functional groups and their electronic interactions, consistent with the assigned formula and SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing insights into the molecular structure. The ¹H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans ~-2 to 14 ppm, while the ¹³C axis (y-axis) ranges from ~0 to 200 ppm. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6.5–8 ppm, 110–160 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this area correspond to the substituted benzene ring (c1cc...cc1Cl) and the pyrazole ring (nn2C). The chlorine substituent (Cl) and methoxy groups (OCH₃, OCH₂OCH₃) induce deshielding, shifting aromatic protons downfield. The benzene ring’s protons exhibit correlations to carbons at ~120–140 ppm, consistent with electron-withdrawing effects from Cl and O-linked substituents. 2. **Aldehyde Group (~9.5 ppm, ~190 ppm):** A distinct cross-peak near (9.5, 190) confirms the presence of the formyl group (C=O) in the pyrazole ring (c(C=O)), with the proton’s high deshielding reflecting the electron-withdrawing carbonyl. 3. **Methoxy and Methylene Groups (3–5 ppm, 50–100 ppm):** Peaks in this region correspond to the OCH₃ (~3.5 ppm, ~55 ppm) and OCH₂OCH₃ (~5 ppm, ~100 ppm) groups. The methylene (OCH₂) appears slightly downfield due to its proximity to two oxygen atoms, while the methoxy groups show typical upfield shifts. 4. **Methyl Groups (2–3 ppm, 10–20 ppm):** Cross-peaks near (2.5, 15) and (3.0, 40) likely arise from the pyrazole methyl (c(C)) and the N-methyl group (nn2C), respectively. The N-methyl’s higher ¹³C shift reflects its attachment to a nitrogen. 5. **Quaternary Carbons:** No correlations are observed for quaternary carbons (e.g., the benzene carbon bonded to Cl or the pyrazole carbon adjacent to N), as HSQC detects only proton-bearing carbons. The spectrum’s dispersion of peaks across a wide chemical shift range highlights the molecule’s diverse electronic environment, influenced by aromaticity, heteroatoms (Cl, N, O), and functional groups. This HSQC data, combined with the provided molecular formula and SMILES, allows precise mapping of proton-carbon connectivity, validating the compound’s structural features."

A broad, strong absorption band centered near 3300 cm⁻¹ is indicative of O–H stretching vibrations, likely arising from both the carboxylic acid (–COOH) and phenolic (–OH) groups. This region is typically broad due to hydrogen bonding interactions. A sharp, intense peak near 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group, while a slightly weaker absorption near 1720 cm⁻¹ may be attributed to the carbonyl group of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group. Additional peaks in the 1500–1600 cm⁻¹ range reflect C=C stretching vibrations of the aromatic ring, consistent with the benzene moiety in the structure. The spectrum also shows a strong absorption near 1250 cm⁻¹, which corresponds to C–O stretching vibrations of the Boc group and the phenolic C–O bond. The fingerprint region below 1500 cm⁻¹ contains complex bending and stretching vibrations of C–H, C–O, and aromatic ring deformations. Notably, the absence of peaks above 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests no free (non-hydrogen-bonded) O–H or N–H groups are present, consistent with the Boc-protected amine and hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl/carboxylic acid functionalities.

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks corresponding to the proton environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at approximately 2.5 ppm (parts per million) is attributed to the methyl group (–CH3) attached to the pyrazole ring, which typically resonates in the 2.0–3.0 ppm range due to deshielding by the adjacent nitrogen atoms. A sharp singlet at ~1.4 ppm corresponds to the nine equivalent protons of the tert-butyl ester group (–C(CH3)3) from the Boc-protected amine, a common feature for such substituents. A moderate-intensity peak near 4.0 ppm likely arises from the methylene group (–CH2–) linking the pyrazole ring to the chlorophenyl group (–CH2–C6H4Cl), as benzylic protons often appear in the 4.0–5.0 ppm region. Additional methylene protons in the piperidine ring (e.g., –CH2–CH2–N–) may contribute to overlapping signals in the 2.5–3.5 ppm range, though they are less distinct in this spectrum. The aromatic region (6.5–8.0 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks of varying intensities, consistent with the presence of three aromatic systems: the pyrazole ring, the benzamide moiety, and the chlorophenyl group. The pyrazole proton (C–H) typically appears as a singlet or doublet near 7.0–8.0 ppm, while the benzamide and chlorophenyl protons generate complex splitting patterns due to their substituted nature. A minor peak near 10 ppm may indicate trace impurities or residual solvent (e.g., DMSO-d6), as no exchangeable protons (e.g., –NH or –OH) are present in the structure. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected proton environments of the molecule, including aliphatic, benzylic, and aromatic regions, with no unexpected signals indicating significant impurities. The integration and chemical shifts support the proposed structure, though further analysis (e.g., coupling constants or 2D NMR) would clarify specific assignments."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic chemical shifts and splitting patterns consistent with the structural features of this sulfonamide-containing compound. Key observations include: 1. **Amide Proton (δ 10.8 ppm)**: A sharp singlet at 10.8 ppm corresponds to the NH proton of the amide group (C(N)=O). This high downfield shift reflects strong hydrogen bonding and deshielding by the adjacent carbonyl group. 2. **Aromatic Region (δ 6.9–7.4 ppm)**: Two doublets at 7.4 ppm and 7.8 ppm (each integrating to 2H) arise from the para-substituted chlorophenyl ring. The splitting pattern confirms a symmetric substitution pattern, with the chlorine atom causing deshielding of the ortho protons (higher δ) relative to the meta protons. 3. **Morpholine Ring Protons (δ 3.5–4.0 ppm)**: Multiplets in this region correspond to the four methylene groups of the morpholine ring (N1CCOCC1). The protons adjacent to the nitrogen (N-CH2) appear slightly downfield (δ 3.8–4.0 ppm) due to the electronegative nitrogen, while the oxygen-adjacent protons (O-CH2) resonate at δ 3.5–3.7 ppm. 4. **Sulfonamide NH (δ 2.5 ppm)**: A broad singlet at 2.5 ppm is attributed to the sulfonamide NH group. This signal is typically broad due to exchange broadening and hydrogen bonding. 5. **Alkyl Chain Protons (δ 1.5–2.2 ppm)**: Overlapping multiplets in this region correspond to the branched alkyl chain, including the isobutyl group ([C@H](CC(C)C)) and the propyl linker (CCC). The methine proton (CH) of the isobutyl group appears as a multiplet near δ 2.0 ppm, while methyl groups (CH3) resonate as doublets at δ 0.9–1.0 ppm (not fully resolved in this spectrum). 6. **Terminal Methyl Groups (δ 0.9–1.0 ppm)**: The two methyl groups of the isobutyl moiety appear as doublets (J ≈ 6.5 Hz) due to coupling with the adjacent methine proton. The integration ratios and splitting patterns align with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of the chlorophenyl, morpholine, sulfonamide, amide, and branched alkyl components. The absence of signals beyond δ 12 ppm or below δ 0 ppm indicates no additional acidic protons or highly shielded environments. This spectrum provides clear evidence for the proposed structure, with all functional groups accounted for through characteristic chemical shifts and coupling interactions."

The spectrum displays seven distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, consistent with the molecular structure. The most downfield peak at ~170 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the amide group, which is strongly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent chlorine atoms and the oxygen atom. Three aromatic carbon signals appear between 125–140 ppm, representing the substituted benzene ring. These peaks exhibit splitting patterns indicative of a monosubstituted phenyl group, with the most intense resonance at ~130 ppm likely corresponding to the carbon para to the thiazolidine ring attachment. A singlet at ~60 ppm is assigned to the carbon adjacent to the sulfur atom in the thiazolidine ring (C-S), which experiences moderate deshielding due to the electronegative sulfur. Two additional aliphatic peaks at ~45 ppm and ~30 ppm correspond to the methylene carbons (CH2) in the five-membered ring, with the more downfield signal (~45 ppm) likely associated with the carbon bonded to the nitrogen atom (C-N). The upfield shift of the ~30 ppm peak reflects the less electronegative environment of the central methylene group in the ring. The absence of peaks above 200 ppm confirms no aldehyde or ketone functionalities beyond the amide group, while the lack of signals below 10 ppm excludes methyl groups in this structure. The observed chemical shifts and peak multiplicities align with the proposed structure, where the thiazolidine ring and dichloroacetamide group create distinct electronic environments for the carbons.

This fragmentation is characteristic of tert-butyl esters, where the ester bond undergoes homolytic cleavage, stabilizing the resulting carboxylic acid fragment. The molecular ion [M+H]+ at m/z 228 confirms the molecular weight of the compound (227.3 Da), with the +1 shift attributed to protonation during ionization. Additional significant peaks include m/z 126 and 127, which likely arise from further fragmentation of the cyclohexanone ring system. The peak at m/z 97 represents the cyclohexanone-derived fragment (C6H9O), formed via cleavage of the C-N bond adjacent to the amino group, leaving the carbonyl-containing ring intact. Peaks at m/z 98 and 100–103 suggest minor rearrangements or hydrogen shifts during fragmentation, while m/z 154 may correspond to a fragment retaining the amino group and partial ring structure. The absence of peaks above m/z 228 confirms no dimerization or adduct formation.

The highest observed m/z value at 351 likely represents a protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, though its relatively low intensity indicates extensive fragmentation. Additional peaks at m/z 98, 105, and 138 are consistent with smaller aromatic and aliphatic fragments, while m/z 269 and 333 may arise from further cleavage of the fluorinated side chain or ether linkage. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 351 confirms the molecular weight aligns with the given formula. The spectrum reflects typical fragmentation pathways for carbamates and aromatic amides, including homolytic cleavage at the Boc group, amide bond scission, and allylic cleavage near the fluorinated alkene. The fluorine atom's presence is indirectly inferred from the stability of certain fragments but does not produce distinct isotope patterns due to its monoisotopic nature (¹⁹F).

The molecular ion peak (M+, m/z 270) is absent, suggesting extensive fragmentation under the ionization conditions. The base peak at m/z 95 likely corresponds to a stable carbocation or oxonium ion derived from cleavage of the ester linkage (C-O bond in the lactone ring), a common fragmentation pathway for oxygenated cyclic structures. The peak at m/z 119 may arise from a retro-aldol-type cleavage of the six-membered lactone ring, releasing a neutral fragment while retaining charge on a hydroxylated cyclopentyl moiety. The adjacent peak at m/z 121 could represent a dehydrated variant of this fragment (loss of H₂O, 18 Da). Peaks at m/z 103 and 107 suggest allylic cleavage near the C=C bond in the side chain, with the cyclopentyl group (C₅H₉, 69 Da) contributing to smaller fragments. The m/z 125 peak may originate from a charged fragment retaining the ester carbonyl and adjacent hydroxyl groups, stabilized by resonance. Higher-mass fragments like m/z 135 and 139 likely represent partial structural motifs, such as the glycosidic bond cleavage product retaining the ethoxy group (C₂H₅O, 45 Da) or the hydroxylated lactone ring. The absence of the molecular ion peak and the dominance of low-mass fragments reflect the molecule’s susceptibility to fragmentation due to labile oxygen-containing functional groups (ester, hydroxyl, and ether) and the strain in the lactone ring. The observed peaks align with expected fragmentation patterns for glycoside-like structures and unsaturated cyclic esters, where charge retention is favored at oxygen-rich sites.

Additional peaks in the aromatic region (120–150 ppm) arise from the benzene and pyridine rings. The benzene ring, substituted with a methyl group, sulfonamide group, and trifluoromethyl group, exhibits multiple resonances due to the asymmetric substitution pattern. The pyridine ring, bearing a chlorine atom and carboxylic acid substituent, contributes further peaks in this region, with the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen (C-2) typically appearing near 150 ppm due to strong deshielding by the electronegative nitrogen.

The spectrum displays a dominant molecular ion peak at m/z 319, corresponding to the intact molecular mass of the compound. This peak represents the parent ion [M]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of C15H12BrFN2 (319 Da). The presence of bromine is evident in the isotopic pattern: a secondary peak at m/z 321, approximately 50% of the intensity of the base peak at 319, reflects the natural abundance of the 79Br and 81Br isotopes.

This fragmentation pathway may involve cleavage of the ethyl group (-C2H5) attached to the triazole ring, leaving a [M - C2H4]+ fragment. Additional bromine-containing fragments appear at m/z 240 and 239, potentially arising from further decomposition of the triazole ring or aryl-bromine bond cleavage. Peaks at m/z 197 and 198 may correspond to a fragment containing the fluorophenyl group (C6H4F) and part of the triazole ring, while peaks at m/z 225 and 226 could indicate a rearrangement or loss of smaller neutral species (e.g., HF or HCN). The absence of significant peaks below m/z 150 suggests limited fragmentation of the aromatic systems, consistent with the stability of the conjugated structure. The spectrum highlights the diagnostic value of bromine’s isotopic signature and the stability of the molecular ion, which dominates the fragmentation pattern. These features align with the structural features of the compound, including the brominated and fluorinated aromatic rings and the triazole core."

The spectrum displays characteristic absorption bands corresponding to key functional groups in the molecule. A prominent sharp peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) group, consistent with the amide moiety in the structure. A distinct nitrile (C≡N) stretch is observed at ~2220 cm⁻¹, aligning with the aromatic cyano substituent. The broad absorption near 3200–3400 cm⁻¹ suggests N–H stretching, likely from the secondary amide. Phosphate ester (P=O) stretches appear as strong bands near 1240 cm⁻¹, while P–O–C vibrations are evident in the 1000–1050 cm⁻¹ region. The aromatic C–H stretches are visible just above 3000 cm⁻¹, and the trifluoromethyl (CF₃) group contributes to absorptions near 1100–1350 cm⁻¹ due to C–F stretching. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains complex vibrations from the heterocyclic core, aromatic rings, and C–N/C–O linkages.

The spectrum displays three prominent peaks at chemical shifts of approximately 12.0 ppm, 10.0 ppm, and 4.0 ppm. The peak at 12.0 ppm is highly downfield, suggesting a proton in a strongly deshielded environment, likely an aromatic proton ortho to the carbonyl group (C=O) in the xanthone core. The electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group deshields adjacent protons, shifting their resonance to lower fields. The peak at 10.0 ppm is also downfield and may correspond to another aromatic proton influenced by both the carbonyl and the oxygen bridge in the xanthone structure, which further disrupts electron density. The most upfield peak at 4.0 ppm is assigned to the two methyl groups (–CH3) attached to the aromatic rings. Methyl groups typically resonate between 2.0–3.0 ppm, but their elevated shift here suggests deshielding due to proximity to the electron-withdrawing oxygen and carbonyl groups, as well as possible ring current effects from the aromatic system. The absence of additional peaks indicates symmetry in the molecule or overlapping signals, consistent with the xanthone scaffold where equivalent protons on the two aromatic rings may coalesce. The integration of these peaks would align with the molecular formula: the 4.0 ppm peak (6H from two methyl groups) and the two downfield peaks (6H total from aromatic protons). This spectrum reflects the electronic and structural features of the xanthone derivative, with substituents modulating proton environments through inductive and resonance effects."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the unique carbon environments in the structure. The most downfield peak at approximately 200 ppm is characteristic of the aldehyde carbonyl carbon (C=O), which is highly deshielded due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atom. Adjacent to this, a peak near 190 ppm may arise from a quaternary aromatic carbon in the naphthalene ring system, potentially influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of the aldehyde group. In the aromatic region (110–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the complex substitution pattern of the naphthalene ring. The peak at ~160 ppm likely corresponds to the carbon directly bonded to the aldehyde group, as the electron-withdrawing nature of the formyl substituent deshields this position. Other aromatic carbons in the naphthalene system appear as a series of peaks between 110–140 ppm, with variations in chemical shift due to their proximity to the aldehyde and the benzyl ether linkage. The peak at ~60 ppm is attributed to the benzyl carbon (CH2) attached to the oxygen of the methanesulfonate group, which is moderately deshielded by the adjacent electronegative oxygen. The methyl group (CH3) of the methanesulfonate moiety resonates at ~40 ppm, consistent with its typical chemical shift range for a sulfonate ester. Notably, the absence of peaks in the 50–100 ppm range (excluding the benzyl carbon) confirms the lack of additional aliphatic or oxygenated carbons beyond those explicitly described. The spectrum aligns with the molecular formula and SMILES notation, providing clear evidence for the presence of the naphthalene core, aldehyde functionality, and methanesulfonate ester group. Each peak’s intensity and position correlate with the expected number of equivalent carbons and their electronic environments, supporting the proposed structure."

The spectrum displays distinct features characteristic of a cyclohexylamine derivative substituted with a para-fluorophenoxy group. Key observations include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6.8–7.2 ppm):** Two doublets in this range correspond to the four aromatic protons of the para-fluorophenyl group. The splitting arises from spin-spin coupling between the fluorine nucleus (¹⁹F, I=½) and adjacent protons, with typical coupling constants (J ≈ 8–9 Hz). The para substitution pattern results in two equivalent pairs of protons, each integrating to 2H. 2. **High-Field Peaks (1.5–2.5 ppm):** A series of multiplets in this region are assigned to the methylene (CH₂) protons of the cyclohexane ring. The complex splitting reflects the chair conformation of the ring, with axial and equatorial protons exhibiting distinct chemical shifts due to anisotropic effects and coupling interactions. 3. **Oxygen-Adjacent Proton (4.3 ppm):** A singlet or broad peak near 4.3 ppm corresponds to the proton on the cyclohexane carbon directly bonded to the oxygen atom (C4 in the SMILES notation). This signal is deshielded due to the electronegativity of oxygen. 4. **Amine-Adjacent Proton (3.5 ppm):** A peak at ~3.5 ppm likely arises from the proton on the cyclohexane carbon bearing the amine group (C1). This shift is consistent with deshielding by the adjacent nitrogen atom. 5. **Exchangeable Protons (10 ppm):** A broad peak near 10 ppm may represent the amine protons (NH₂), though their exact appearance depends on solvent and exchange conditions. In protic solvents or acidic conditions, these protons could appear as a broad singlet due to rapid exchange. The absence of signals in the 9–10 ppm range (e.g., aldehyde or carboxylic acid protons) confirms the lack of such functional groups in the structure. The spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, where the para-fluorophenoxy and amine substituents on the cyclohexane ring dictate the observed chemical shifts and splitting patterns. Integration of peaks would further validate the proton count (16H total), though the provided intensity scale suggests relative peak areas are consistent with the molecular formula."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 476, corresponding to the intact molecule. This peak confirms the molecular weight of the compound, consistent with the given formula. Notable fragment ions are observed at m/z 444, 420, 416, 402, 360, 346, 332, and 214, providing insights into the compound’s structural features. The peak at m/z 444 (32 mass units below the molecular ion) suggests the loss of a neutral fragment, potentially a methyl group (CH3, 15 Da) and a hydroxyl radical (OH, 17 Da), which is common in ester-containing compounds like this one (the COC(=O) group in the SMILES notation). The fragment at m/z 420 (56 Da below the parent ion) may arise from the elimination of a C4H8 group, likely originating from the tert-butyl ether moiety (OC(C)(C)C) in the structure. A cluster of peaks at m/z 416, 402, and 360 indicates further fragmentation of the aromatic and heterocyclic components. The m/z 416 peak (10 Da below 426, though not directly observed here) could reflect the loss of a fluorine atom (F, 19 Da) or a smaller fragment like CO (28 Da), though the exact pathway requires additional context. The peak at m/z 360 (116 Da below the molecular ion) may correspond to cleavage of the ester group and adjacent carbon-carbon bonds, releasing a C6H12O fragment. The peak at m/z 214 represents a smaller, stable fragment, likely derived from the thienopyridine core (sc3c(c2c1)CCCC3 in the SMILES) or the chlorophenyl substituent (c1ccc(Cl)cc1F). The presence of chlorine is supported by the isotope pattern: peaks at m/z 415, 416, and 417 exhibit a ~3:1 ratio, characteristic of the 35Cl and 37Cl isotopes. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the stability of the heterocyclic system and the susceptibility of the ester and ether groups to cleavage. The high relative abundance of the molecular ion (base peak at 476) suggests limited decomposition under the ionization conditions, typical of electron ionization (EI) for moderately polar organic molecules."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption features consistent with an ester functional group and aliphatic hydrocarbon chains. The most prominent peak occurs at approximately 1740 cm⁻¹, corresponding to the strong stretching vibration of the carbonyl (C=O) group, a hallmark of esters. This absorption is sharp and intense, confirming the presence of the polar carbonyl moiety in the structure. Adjacent to this peak, weaker absorptions around 2900 cm⁻¹ arise from symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of aliphatic C-H bonds in the sp³-hybridized carbon framework of the molecule. A moderate absorption near 1200 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the C-O stretching vibration of the ester linkage, while a slightly less intense band around 1100 cm⁻¹ likely corresponds to the C-O-C asymmetric stretching mode. These features collectively reinforce the ester functionality. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), multiple peaks between 1460–1375 cm⁻¹ are observed, which originate from bending vibrations of CH₂ and CH₃ groups, including scissoring and symmetric deformation modes. The peak at ~1375 cm⁻¹ specifically indicates the presence of methyl (CH₃) groups, consistent with the branched alkyl chain (CCCC(C)C) in the molecular structure. No significant absorption is observed in the 3200–3600 cm⁻¹ range, confirming the absence of hydroxyl (O-H) or amine (N-H) groups, aligning with the ester classification. The overall spectral profile, including the carbonyl stretch, C-O vibrations, and aliphatic C-H signatures, is consistent with ethyl 4-methylpentanoate, the ester derived from ethanol and 4-methylpentanoic acid. The branching in the alkyl chain (from the methyl substituent) contributes to the complexity of the fingerprint region, where overlapping vibrational modes of the hydrocarbon skeleton are evident. This IR spectrum provides clear evidence of the ester functional group and the saturated hydrocarbon framework defined by the molecular formula C9H18O2."

Key features include a prominent peak near 150 ppm, which likely corresponds to the quaternary carbons in the quinazoline ring system (C2 and C4 positions of the heterocycle), reflecting deshielding due to adjacent nitrogen atoms. Additional aromatic signals appear between 110–130 ppm, consistent with substituted benzene rings, including the fluorinated and chlorinated phenyl group (C3'–C6') and the aniline-derived portion of the quinazoline. The downfield shift near 170 ppm suggests the presence of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) from the amide side chain, which is strongly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent nitrogen and oxygen. In the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm), a peak near 40 ppm is observed, likely representing the methylene carbons (CH2) adjacent to the amide nitrogen (N-CH2-CH2-CH2-), while a smaller signal near 20 ppm may correspond to the terminal methyl group (CH3) of the butylamine side chain. The fluorine substituent on the phenyl ring induces a slight upfield shift in the ortho-carbon (C2' or C6'), while the chlorine substituent causes deshielding in its adjacent carbons due to its electronegativity and inductive effects. The absence of signals below 0 ppm or above 200 ppm confirms the absence of highly shielded or exceptionally deshielded environments, such as sp3-hybridized carbons in strained rings or carboxylic acid derivatives. The spectrum’s peak multiplicities and integration patterns align with the expected 18 carbon environments in the molecule, though some overlapping signals may occur due to symmetry in the aromatic systems. The overall distribution of chemical shifts supports the proposed structure, with distinct differentiation between aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic carbons. This C-NMR data provides critical insights into the electronic and structural features of the compound, including the influence of halogen substituents and the conjugated quinazoline core on carbon shielding."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing through-bond connectivity for CH, CH₂, and CH₃ groups. The spectrum displays distinct cross-peaks corresponding to the molecule’s protonated carbons. Key features include: 1. **Methyl Groups**: Three distinct methyl environments are observed. The acetamide methyl (CC(=O)N–) appears at ~2.0 ppm (¹H) and ~25 ppm (¹³C), reflecting deshielding by the adjacent carbonyl group. The thiazole ring methyl (–C(CH₃)–) is slightly upfield at ~2.3 ppm (¹H) and ~15 ppm (¹³C), consistent with its position on an aromatic heterocycle. The methylsulfonyl group (–SO₂C(CH₃)) exhibits a peak at ~3.1 ppm (¹H) and ~42 ppm (¹³C), indicative of strong deshielding by the sulfonyl moiety. 2. **Aromatic Region**: The thiazole and benzene rings show multiple correlations.

This region highlights the heterocyclic ring’s electronic effects. 4. **Quaternary Carbons**: No correlations are observed for quaternary carbons (e.g., carbonyl, nitrile, or sulfone carbons), as HSQC only detects directly bonded ¹H–¹³C pairs. The spectrum confirms the presence of all protonated carbons and their chemical environments, aligning with the molecular structure. The methylsulfonyl and cyano substituents on the benzene ring, along with the acetamide and thiazole methyl groups, are clearly resolved, enabling precise assignment of the molecule’s aliphatic and aromatic components.

The spectrum displays characteristic proton resonances across the chemical shift range of 14 to -2 ppm. Key features include a prominent singlet at ~12.5 ppm, likely corresponding to the carboxylic acid proton (COOH), which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and electronegative oxygen atoms. A sharp peak at ~10.5 ppm may arise from the amide proton (NH), also deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl group. The aromatic region (6.8–8.5 ppm) exhibits multiple signals, including a doublet at ~8.2 ppm and a multiplet at ~7.8 ppm, assignable to the pyridine and fluorinated benzene ring protons. The fluorine substituents induce spin-spin coupling, splitting adjacent aromatic protons into doublets or triplets. A triplet at ~7.2 ppm and a doublet at ~6.8 ppm suggest meta- and para-substituted aromatic environments. In the aliphatic region (1.8–4.3 ppm), a quartet at ~4.3 ppm and a triplet at ~3.8 ppm correspond to the methylene groups (CH2) adjacent to the amide nitrogen and pyrrolidine ring, respectively. The pyrrolidine ring protons (CH2) appear as overlapping multiplets between 1.8–2.2 ppm, reflecting their diastereotopic environments. Notably, the fluorinated benzene ring protons (3.8–7.2 ppm) show reduced integration due to signal suppression by fluorine’s quadrupolar relaxation effects. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s structural diversity, including aromatic systems, amide linkages, and a chiral pyrrolidine moiety. Integration ratios align with the molecular formula, confirming the presence of 18 protons across distinct chemical environments. This H-NMR data provides critical insights into the compound’s conformational and electronic structure, consistent with its pharmacophore design."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C14H19NO2S (SMILES: COC(=O)c1sc(C2=CCC(C)(C)CC2)cc1N). The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 266, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 265.36 g/mol for C14H19NO2S. The base peak at m/z 206 suggests a dominant fragmentation pathway involving the loss of a 60 Da fragment, likely the ester group (-COOCH3), consistent with the structure’s methyl ester functionality. Additional significant peaks at m/z 249 and 252 may arise from sequential losses of small neutral fragments, such as NH3 or H2O, from the molecular ion. The peak at m/z 182 corresponds to a fragment retaining the thiophene ring (C4H3S) and part of the cyclohexene substituent, while peaks at m/z 151 and 124 suggest further cleavage of the aromatic system or aliphatic side chains. The presence of sulfur is corroborated by minor isotopic peaks at m/z 208 and 268 (M+2), reflecting the natural abundance of 34S (~4.2%). Other minor peaks (e.g., m/z 79, 93, 109) likely originate from heterocyclic ring fragmentation or alkyl chain breakdown. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern is consistent with the structural features of the molecule, including the thiophene core, ester group, and tert-butyl-substituted cyclohexene ring. These observations provide insights into the compound’s stability under ionization and its characteristic decomposition pathways."

The spectrum displays correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing key structural features through distinct chemical shift patterns. In the downfield region of the ¹H axis (10–12 ppm), a sparse cluster of peaks suggests the presence of deshielded protons, likely associated with the conjugated double bond (C=CN(C)C) or the heterocyclic NH environment. The corresponding ¹³C shifts in this region (150–170 ppm) align with sp²-hybridized carbons in the carbonyl (C=O) or aromatic-like framework of the bicyclic system. A prominent peak near 170 ppm on the ¹³C axis, paired with a ¹H shift of ~4.5 ppm, corresponds to the ester carbonyl carbon (C(=O)O) and its adjacent methylene protons (CH₂O). Additional correlations in the 50–70 ppm ¹³C range with ¹H shifts of 2.5–4.0 ppm indicate aliphatic carbons bonded to electronegative atoms, such as the N-methyl groups (N(CH₃)) or the tertiary carbon in the CCC(C)(NC)NC fragment. The aliphatic region (0–50 ppm on the ¹³C axis) exhibits multiple peaks with ¹H shifts of 1.0–3.0 ppm, consistent with methyl and methylene groups in the side chains. Notably, the absence of correlations in the 100–150 ppm ¹³C range for ¹H shifts below 5 ppm suggests limited aromatic character beyond the conjugated system. The distribution of peaks reflects the molecule’s complexity, with the HSQC effectively resolving overlapping signals from the heterocyclic core, ester functionality, and branched aliphatic substituents.

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to functional groups in the molecule. A broad, moderate-intensity band near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests O–H stretching vibrations, likely from the two hydroxyl groups in the (C(CO)CO) moiety. Sharp peaks around 2900 cm⁻¹ are attributed to aliphatic C–H stretching in the ethyl (CCO) and piperazine-derived (CCN) groups. A prominent peak near 2200 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the nitrile (C≡N) group on the pyridine ring. The absence of strong absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates no carbonyl (C=O) groups, consistent with the molecular structure. Multiple sharp peaks between 1600–1000 cm⁻¹ arise from aromatic C=C stretching in the pyridine, oxadiazole, and benzene rings, as well as C–N stretching in the heterocycles.

The spectrum exhibits characteristic peaks corresponding to the structural features of this Boc-protected piperidine derivative with a 4-chlorobenzylamine substituent. The most prominent peak at **1.4 ppm** (singlet) arises from the nine equivalent protons of the tert-butyl group in the Boc moiety. This sharp singlet is a hallmark of the symmetric tert-butyl environment. Adjacent to this, a broad multiplet at **1.5–2.0 ppm** integrates to four protons, assignable to the two methylene groups (CH₂) in the piperidine ring that are not directly bonded to heteroatoms. These protons experience moderate deshielding due to their proximity to the ring nitrogen. A triplet at **2.7 ppm** (2H) corresponds to the methylene protons (CH₂) adjacent to the benzylamine nitrogen (-CH₂-NH-). This signal is slightly downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent nitrogen. Another triplet at **3.2 ppm** (2H) is attributed to the methylene protons (CH₂) on the piperidine ring directly bonded to the Boc-protected nitrogen (-N-CH₂-). The deshielding here reflects the electronegativity of the nitrogen and the carbonyl group. The aromatic region displays a **multiplet at 7.2–7.4 ppm** (4H), consistent with the four protons of the para-substituted chlorophenyl ring. The splitting pattern reflects the meta coupling in the aromatic system, with the chlorine substituent causing slight downfield shifts for the ortho and para protons. Notably, the NH proton of the benzylamine moiety is not distinctly visible, likely due to rapid exchange with trace water or broadening in the solvent used (common in CDCl₃). Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, with key features including the Boc group, piperidine ring, and chlorophenyl substituent clearly resolved. The chemical shifts and splitting patterns provide strong evidence for the molecular architecture described by the SMILES notation."

The strong absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ is diagnostic of the carbonyl (C=O) stretch in the carboxylic acid moiety. Additional peaks between 1600–1450 cm⁻¹ arise from aromatic C=C stretching vibrations, reflecting the presence of multiple substituted phenyl rings in the structure. The region between 1300–1000 cm⁻¹ shows complex overlapping bands, including C-N stretching from the thiazole ring (sc(N)c1), C-S stretching from the sulfur atom in the heterocycle, and C-O stretching from the carboxylic acid.

A broad, intense peak centered near 3300 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid (O-H) stretching vibration, consistent with the terminal -COOH group in the structure. Sharp, well-defined peaks at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1250 cm⁻¹ correspond to the C=O stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid and the C-O stretching vibration of the ester linkage, respectively. Additional peaks in the 3000–2850 cm⁻¹ range reflect C-H stretching vibrations from the aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons in the molecule. The aromatic ring system is evidenced by medium-intensity peaks near 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1500 cm⁻¹, attributed to C=C stretching vibrations of the benzene ring. A distinct absorption band near 1050 cm⁻¹ likely arises from the C-O-C asymmetric stretching of the ether linkage (OCH2 group).

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C15H23N3 (SMILES: Nc1ccc(N2CCN(C3CCCC3)CC2)cc1). The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the carbon environments in the aromatic and aliphatic regions. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), four prominent peaks are observed at approximately 115, 120, 130, and 145 ppm. These correspond to the six aromatic carbons of the benzene ring, which is substituted with an amino group (-NH2) at position 1 and a piperazine ring at position 4 (para to the amino group). The peak at 145 ppm is assigned to the carbon directly bonded to the electron-donating amino group, which deshields this position significantly. The peaks at 115 and 120 ppm represent the ortho and meta carbons relative to the amino group, while the peak at 130 ppm corresponds to the carbon bonded to the piperazine nitrogen. The symmetry of the para-substituted benzene ring reduces the number of unique aromatic signals. In the aliphatic region (0–100 ppm), peaks are observed at ~25, 30, 50, and 60 ppm. The signals at 25 and 30 ppm arise from the cyclopentyl group (C3CCCC3) attached to the piperazine nitrogen, with the lower shifts reflecting the relatively shielded methylene carbons in the saturated ring. The peaks at 50 and 60 ppm correspond to the piperazine ring carbons. The higher shift at 60 ppm is attributed to the methylene carbons adjacent to the substituted nitrogen (bearing the cyclopentyl group), while the 50 ppm peak reflects the methylene carbons near the unsubstituted nitrogen. The absence of additional peaks in this region confirms the symmetry of the piperazine ring in solution. The spectrum aligns with the expected structure, where the amino and piperazine substituents create distinct electronic environments for the aromatic carbons, and the cyclopentyl group contributes to the aliphatic region. The integration of peak intensities further supports the 15-carbon framework, with the aromatic and aliphatic regions accounting for six and nine carbons, respectively. This analysis underscores the utility of C-NMR in resolving structural features through chemical shift and symmetry considerations."

The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, reflecting the molecule's structural complexity. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet near 10 ppm, characteristic of the indole NH proton, which is deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent aromatic system. Additional aromatic protons appear between 6–8 ppm, corresponding to the indole ring (e.g., H-4, H-5, H-6, H-7) and the chlorophenyl ring (H-2', H-4', H-5'), with splitting patterns influenced by substituent effects and coupling interactions. A high-intensity singlet at ~2 ppm suggests the presence of equivalent methyl groups, likely from the diethylamide moiety (N(CH2CH3)2), where the ethyl CH3 protons resonate in this region. Peaks around 3–4 ppm correspond to the CH2 groups of the ethyl substituents and the diastereotopic protons of the CH2NH group in the side chain. A resonance near 5 ppm may arise from the CH2OH group, where the hydroxyl proton typically broadens or shifts depending on solvent and hydrogen bonding. The spectrum also reveals a multiplet at ~1 ppm, assignable to the methyl group of the chiral center (C[C@@H](C)), though its exact position may vary due to conformational effects. Overall, the spectral features align with the proposed structure, demonstrating key proton environments in the aromatic, aliphatic, and heteroatom-adjacent regions, consistent with the molecular formula and SMILES notation provided."

A prominent singlet appears at approximately 11.5 ppm, which is unusually downfield and suggests a highly deshielded proton. This signal likely corresponds to the vinyl proton on the carbon adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl chloride group (O=C(Cl)-C=CH-), where the strong deshielding effect of the carbonyl and conjugation with the aromatic ring shifts the resonance to this extreme low-field region. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), three distinct peaks are observed at ~7.8, 7.6, and 7.4 ppm. These arise from the four aromatic protons on the benzene ring substituted with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) and the acryloyl chloride moiety (-C=C-COCl). The -CF3 group is a strong electron-withdrawing substituent, creating deshielding effects on ortho and para protons, while the acryloyl chloride group further influences the electronic environment. The splitting pattern reflects the non-equivalent proton environments due to the asymmetry introduced by the two substituents. The integration of these peaks (not shown) would typically sum to four protons, consistent with the aromatic ring's substitution pattern. No signals are observed in the aliphatic region (0–4 ppm), confirming the absence of saturated carbons or isolated alkyl groups.

Additional prominent peaks are observed at m/z 173, 240, 242, and 302, with smaller but notable signals at m/z 112, 113, 119, 130, 145, 147, 156, 157, 158, 174, 199, and 284. The absence of a detectable molecular ion peak (expected at m/z 357 based on the molecular formula) suggests extensive fragmentation under the ionization conditions, likely due to the labile tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group and the heterocyclic core. The base peak at m/z 258 arises from the loss of the Boc group (C4H9O2, 100 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for carbamate-protected amines. This is supported by the presence of a smaller peak at m/z 302, which may correspond to a rearrangement ion or a fragment retaining part of the Boc moiety. The peaks at m/z 173 and 174 suggest cleavage of the piperidine ring, generating a benzimidazole-derived fragment (C10H9N3O, 187 Da minus 14 Da for a possible methyl loss).

The peaks at m/z 240 and 242 exhibit a 3:1 intensity ratio, indicative of chlorine isotope patterns; however, the absence of chlorine in the molecular formula implies these arise from overlapping fragments or instrumental artifacts. The peak at m/z 284 may represent a fragment retaining the Boc group after cleavage of the benzimidazole ring. The low-abundance signals below m/z 100 likely correspond to small hydrocarbon fragments from the piperidine or tert-butyl groups. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, particularly the Boc-protected amine and the benzimidazole core. The spectrum highlights the utility of mass spectrometry in probing functional group stability and bond cleavage pathways in complex organic molecules."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C6H9NO3 (SMILES: COC(=O)C1CCC(=O)N1). The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum displays cross-peaks that correlate directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing insights into the molecular structure. In this spectrum, three distinct cross-peaks are observed, consistent with the presence of three types of protonated carbons in the molecule. The first cross-peak appears at approximately 3.7 ppm (¹H) and 52 ppm (¹³C), corresponding to the methyl ester group (-OCH₃). The chemical shift of the methyl protons (~3.7 ppm) is characteristic of a methoxy group adjacent to an electron-withdrawing carbonyl, while the carbon resonance (~52 ppm) aligns with typical ester methyl carbons. Two additional cross-peaks are observed in the aliphatic region. One occurs at ~2.5 ppm (¹H) and ~40 ppm (¹³C), and the other at ~1.8 ppm (¹H) and ~28 ppm (¹³C). These peaks correspond to the two distinct CH₂ groups in the five-membered lactam ring. The CH₂ group adjacent to the amide carbonyl (closer to the C=O) experiences deshielding, resulting in a downfield ¹H shift (~2.5 ppm) and a ¹³C shift (~40 ppm). The more shielded CH₂ group, located further from the carbonyl, exhibits upfield shifts (~1.8 ppm for ¹H and ~28 ppm for ¹³C). The absence of cross-peaks in the aromatic or olefinic regions (e.g., 6–8 ppm for ¹H and 100–150 ppm for ¹³C) confirms the lack of sp²-hybridized carbons with directly attached protons. Additionally, the carbonyl carbons (ester and amide) are not observed in the HSQC spectrum, as they lack directly bonded protons. This HSQC spectrum effectively maps the protonated carbons in the molecule, corroborating the structural features of the lactam ring and methyl ester group in COC(=O)C1CCC(=O)N1. The data aligns with the expected chemical environment for each proton-carbon pair, offering a clear correlation between spectral features and molecular structure."

The spectrum displays three distinct cross-peaks, indicating direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei in the molecule. The ¹H chemical shifts are observed in the aromatic region, with peaks centered near 12.0, 11.0, and 10.0 ppm, while the corresponding ¹³C shifts appear between 150 and 180 ppm. These features align with the expected aromatic protons and their attached carbons in the pyridine ring. The high ¹H chemical shifts (10–12 ppm) suggest significant deshielding, likely due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the cyano (-C≡N) and pentafluoroethyl (-C(F)(F)C(F)(F)F) substituents. The ¹³C shifts in the 150–180 ppm range confirm the presence of sp²-hybridized carbons in an electron-deficient aromatic system. Notably, the absence of peaks outside this region is consistent with the molecular structure, as the cyano and pentafluoroethyl groups lack directly bonded protons. The HSQC data effectively maps the three aromatic protons to their respective carbons, providing insight into the electronic environment shaped by the substituents. This analysis supports the assigned structure, where the pyridine ring is substituted at the 2-position with a cyano group and at the 4-position with a pentafluoroethyl group, leaving three aromatic protons (at positions 3, 5, and 6) to contribute to the observed spectral features."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C8H10S (SMILES: CCc1cccc(S)c1). The spectrum displays direct correlations between proton (1H) and carbon (13C) nuclei, revealing key structural features of the molecule. In the aromatic region, three prominent cross-peaks are observed between 6.5–8.0 ppm (1H) and 120–140 ppm (13C), consistent with the four aromatic protons and carbons of the benzene ring. These signals reflect the substituted benzene core, where the ethyl group (CC-) and thiol (-SH) substituents create distinct electronic environments for the ring protons and carbons. The downfield shifts of certain aromatic protons (closer to 8 ppm) suggest deshielding effects from the electron-withdrawing thiol group, while others (near 6.5 ppm) may reside in less perturbed positions. In the aliphatic region, two cross-peaks are visible: one near 2.5–3.0 ppm (1H) and 25–30 ppm (13C), corresponding to the methylene (-CH2-) group of the ethyl substituent, and another near 1.0–1.5 ppm (1H) and 10–15 ppm (13C), assigned to the terminal methyl (-CH3) group. The methylene protons are slightly deshielded due to proximity to the aromatic ring, while the methyl group exhibits a typical upfield shift. Notably, the thiol proton (-SH) does not appear in the HSQC spectrum, as HSQC detects only protons directly bonded to carbons. The absence of additional peaks confirms the molecule’s simplicity: a monosubstituted ethyl group and a single thiol group on the benzene ring. The observed chemical shifts and coupling patterns align with the expected electronic and steric effects of the substituents, supporting the proposed structure. This HSQC spectrum effectively maps the molecule’s carbon-proton framework, validating its identity as 3-(ethyl)thiophenol (CCc1cccc(S)c1)."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak, located near 150 ppm, is attributed to the aromatic carbon directly bonded to the methylthio (-SCH3) group, which experiences deshielding due to the electronegative sulfur atom. Adjacent aromatic carbons in the substituted benzene rings appear as multiple peaks between 120–140 ppm, reflecting their varying electronic environments influenced by the sulfonamide (-SO2NH2) and nitrile (-C#N) substituents. A sharp peak near 50 ppm corresponds to the quaternary carbon bearing both the nitrile and the secondary amine (-NH-) group, which is deshielded by the adjacent electron-withdrawing functionalities. The sulfonamide group’s sulfur atom further influences the chemical shifts of nearby aromatic carbons, contributing to the splitting pattern observed in the aromatic region. A small peak near 0 ppm is consistent with the methyl carbon of the -SCH3 group, which is shielded due to its aliphatic nature. The absence of peaks above 160 ppm indicates no carbonyl or highly conjugated carbonyl-like environments, aligning with the absence of such groups in the molecular structure. Overall, the spectrum reflects the molecule’s aromaticity, the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents, and the distinct chemical environments of its carbon atoms."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption features consistent with the functional groups present in this ester-containing heterocyclic compound. The most prominent peak appears near 1700 cm⁻¹, corresponding to the strong C=O stretching vibration of the ester carbonyl group. This band is sharp and intense, typical of unconjugated ester functionalities. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), multiple distinct absorptions are observed. Peaks around 1250–1300 cm⁻¹ and 1050–1150 cm⁻¹ arise from C-O stretching vibrations in both the ester and ether moieties (C1CCOCC1 and C2CCOCC2 groups). The aromatic C-H bending vibrations manifest as weaker bands near 700–900 cm⁻¹, while the C=C stretching vibrations of the benzene ring contribute to moderate absorptions in the 1500–1600 cm⁻¹ range. Notably, the absence of broad O-H or N-H stretching bands in the 3200–3600 cm⁻¹ region confirms the lack of hydroxyl or primary/secondary amine groups in the structure. The sharpness of the carbonyl peak and the presence of multiple ether-related bands align with the molecular architecture, which includes two tetrahydropyran rings linked via ester and pyrazole functionalities. The pyrazole ring’s C=N stretching vibrations may contribute to subtle absorptions near 1600 cm⁻¹, though these are less distinct due to overlap with aromatic C=C modes. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the ester, ether, and aromatic components defined by the SMILES notation, with no extraneous functional group signatures detected. The observed peaks collectively validate the structural features of C18H22N2O4 as described."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon environments across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the structural diversity of the molecule. Key features include: 1. **Alkyl Chain and Tert-Butyl Group (0–50 ppm):** The low-field region (0–50 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks corresponding to the hexyl chain (CCCCCC) and the tert-butyl group. The methyl groups of the tert-butyl moiety typically resonate around 25–35 ppm due to their electron-donating nature, while the central quaternary carbon of the tert-butyl group appears slightly downfield (30–40 ppm). The methylene (CH2) units of the hexyl chain are observed in the 10–30 ppm range, with terminal methyl groups near 10–15 ppm. 2. **Oxygenated and Piperidine Ring Carbons (50–100 ppm):** Peaks in the 50–100 ppm region arise from carbons adjacent to electronegative atoms. The hydroxyl-bearing carbon in the piperidine ring ([C@@H](O)) is deshielded, appearing around 60–75 ppm. The adjacent carbons in the piperidine ring (e.g., those near the nitrogen) resonate in the 40–60 ppm range due to the inductive effect of nitrogen. 3. **Aromatic Carbons (100–150 ppm):** The aromatic ring contributes to multiple peaks between 110–150 ppm. The carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group (c(O)c1) is highly deshielded, typically appearing near 140–150 ppm. Other aromatic carbons (ortho, meta, para to substituents) exhibit shifts in the 110–135 ppm range, reflecting their electronic environments. The tert-butyl-substituted aromatic carbon may appear slightly upfield (120–130 ppm) due to the electron-donating effect of the alkyl group. 4. **Quaternary and Substituted Carbons:** The spectrum lacks peaks above 150 ppm, confirming the absence of carbonyl or carboxyl groups. The observed peaks align with the molecular formula, which includes only two hydroxyl groups and no sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons. This C-NMR spectrum effectively illustrates the molecule’s structural features, with distinct chemical shifts for alkyl, aromatic, and heterocyclic components. The distribution of peaks reflects the symmetry of the tert-butyl group, the electron-withdrawing effects of oxygen and nitrogen, and the substitution pattern on the benzene ring."

A broad, intense band centered near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the O–H stretching vibration of the secondary alcohol group, indicating hydrogen bonding interactions. Sharp peaks around 2950 cm⁻¹ and 2850 cm⁻¹ arise from symmetric and asymmetric C–H stretching vibrations in the aliphatic regions of the molecule, including the ethyl linker and piperidine ring. A prominent absorption near 2100 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the azide (–N₃) asymmetric stretching mode, a hallmark of the terminal azide group in the structure. This band is typically sharp and intense due to the high polarity of the N=N bonds. The sulfonyl (–SO₂–) group generates two strong, well-defined peaks at approximately 1350 cm⁻¹ and 1150 cm⁻¹, corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric S=O stretching vibrations, respectively. These absorptions confirm the presence of the sulfonate ester functionality. Additional features in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) include a peak near 1050 cm⁻¹, likely associated with C–O stretching in the ether linkage adjacent to the sulfonyl group. The piperidine ring contributes to multiple weaker absorptions between 1000–600 cm⁻¹, including C–N stretching and ring deformation modes. The absence of significant peaks above 3500 cm⁻¹ or near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of free carboxylic acid or carbonyl groups in the molecule. Overall, the spectral profile aligns with the assigned structure, providing clear evidence for the hydroxyl, azide, sulfonyl, and aliphatic ether functionalities.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between 1H and 13C nuclei, revealingthrough-bond connectivity in the molecule. The spectrum displays three distinct regions of interest corresponding to different structural motifs in the compound. In the downfield region (1H: 10–12 ppm; 13C: 100–120 ppm), a cluster of peaks is observed, indicative of aromatic protons and their attached carbons. These signals likely arise from the indole-like aromatic system (c2ccccc12) and the dichlorinated benzoyl group (c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl), where deshielding effects from electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., Cl, carbonyl) shift protons to higher ppm values. The splitting pattern and chemical shifts align with substituted benzene rings, consistent with the molecular structure. A second group of peaks appears in the mid-field region (1H: 6–8 ppm; 13C: 120–150 ppm), corresponding to additional aromatic or alkenyl protons and their attached carbons. This region likely reflects protons on the indole core (e.g., positions adjacent to the nitrogen) and the benzoyl moiety, where moderate deshielding occurs due to conjugation and electronegative substituents. The upfield region (1H: 2–4 ppm; 13C: 20–40 ppm) contains fewer, more dispersed peaks. These signals are characteristic of aliphatic protons and carbons, such as the methyl group (c(C)) attached to the indole nitrogen and the ethyl ester side chain (CCOC(=O)CH2). The methyl group typically resonates near 2.5–3.5 ppm in 1H and 15–30 ppm in 13C, while the CH2 group of the ethyl ester appears slightly downfield due to proximity to the carbonyl. Notably, the spectrum lacks signals in the carbonyl region (13C: 160–180 ppm), as HSQC only detects carbons directly bonded to protons. The two carbonyl groups in the molecule (ester and amide) are quaternary and thus absent here. Similarly, the chlorine-substituted aromatic carbons (bearing no protons) are not visible. The overall spectral pattern confirms the presence of aromatic, aliphatic, and heteroatom-substituted environments consistent with the assigned structure. The distribution of peaks supports the molecular framework of a dichlorinated benzoyl-indole derivative with an ethyl ester side chain, as defined by the SMILES notation. This HSQC spectrum serves as a critical tool for assigning protonated carbons and validating the connectivity of the synthesized compound."

A broad, moderate-intensity peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ is attributed to N–H stretching vibrations from the secondary amide group. Sharp, strong peaks at approximately 1730 cm⁻¹ and 1640 cm⁻¹ correspond to the carbonyl (C=O) stretches of the ester and amide functionalities, respectively. The ester C=O appears at a higher wavenumber than the amide C=O, consistent with the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent oxygen atom. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), multiple peaks arise from complex vibrational modes. A prominent peak near 1500 cm⁻¹ is indicative of aromatic C=C stretching, while a sharp absorption around 1200 cm⁻¹ likely corresponds to C–O stretching in the ester group. The presence of fluorine is reflected in the C–F stretching vibration, observed as a moderate band near 1100 cm⁻¹. Peaks between 2800–3000 cm⁻¹ are assigned to aliphatic C–H stretching vibrations from the cyclopentyl (C2CCCC2) and ethyl (CCO) groups.

Adjacent to this, a sharp peak at ~2950 cm⁻¹ arises from aliphatic C-H stretching in the methyl and methylene groups. The most prominent feature is the strong carbonyl (C=O) stretching band at ~1700 cm⁻¹, attributable to the carboxylic acid moiety, while a slightly weaker band at ~1650 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the amide C=O stretch from the -CC(N)=O substituent.

The most prominent resonance appears near 50 ppm, likely corresponding to the aliphatic carbon in the methoxy group (OCH₃) and the benzylic CH₂ group linking the aromatic rings. This region is characteristic of sp³-hybridized carbons bonded to electronegative atoms (oxygen/nitrogen) or adjacent to aromatic systems. Between 100–150 ppm, multiple sharp peaks are observed, indicative of sp²-hybridized aromatic carbons. The peak near 150 ppm likely arises from the quaternary carbon in the central aromatic ring (bearing the methoxy group), as electron-withdrawing substituents such as oxygen typically deshield carbons, shifting their signals downfield. Additional peaks in the 120–130 ppm range correspond to fluorinated aromatic carbons, as fluorine’s strong electronegativity and spin-spin coupling (¹⁹F–¹³C interactions) often broaden or split carbon signals in its vicinity. The absence of significant peaks above 150 ppm suggests no carbonyl or highly deshielded carbons are present, consistent with the molecular formula. The spectrum also shows moderate-intensity peaks near 40–50 ppm, possibly from the CH₂ group in the -CH₂NH- linker, which experiences deshielding due to the adjacent nitrogen. The overall peak distribution aligns with the molecular symmetry implied by the SMILES notation, with fewer peaks than the total carbon count (20) due to overlapping signals from equivalent or similar environments. The fluorine substituents (-F on aromatic rings) likely contribute to peak splitting patterns, though proton-decoupled C-NMR typically simplifies such interactions. This spectrum highlights the structural complexity of the molecule, with distinct regions for aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroatom-adjacent carbons, providing insights into the electronic effects of fluorine, oxygen, and nitrogen substituents on the carbon framework."

Aromatic protons appear as a pair of doublets between δ 7.3–7.4 ppm (each integrating to two protons), indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring. The sulfone-adjacent methylene group (-CH2-SO2-) resonates as a triplet at δ 2.7 ppm (integration: 2H), split by coupling to neighboring protons. Adjacent to this, a multiplet at δ 2.8–3.0 ppm (integration: 2H) corresponds to the -CH2- group directly bonded to the sulfonyl moiety, which also exhibits coupling with nearby protons.

The peak at 6.5 ppm (¹H) and 50 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to a proton in an aromatic or deshielded environment, likely associated with the pyrimidine ring. The elevated ¹H shift suggests proximity to electron-withdrawing bromine substituents or nitrogen atoms in the heterocycle.

The spectrum displays a dominant molecular ion peak at m/z 306, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound (calculated monoisotopic mass: 305.28 Da), confirming the molecular formula C18H11NO4. The base peak at m/z 306 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions used. Key fragment ions are observed at m/z 278, 249, 188, 159, 145, 119, and 109, reflecting characteristic cleavage patterns. The peak at m/z 278 (306 – 28 Da) suggests loss of a carbonyl group (CO), likely originating from the ketone (O=C1CC) or methylenedioxy (OCO3) moiety. The ion at m/z 249 (278 – 29 Da) may arise from subsequent loss of a formyl radical (CHO•) or ethylene (C2H4), consistent with fragmentation of the benzofuran ring system (c2coc3ccccc23). The m/z 188 peak (306 – 118 Da) corresponds to cleavage of the central quinoline-like core, retaining the benzofuran and methylenedioxy substituents. Fragment ions at m/z 159 and 145 likely originate from further decomposition of the benzofuran ring, with 145 representing a loss of 14 Da (CH2) from 159, possibly due to methylene cleavage in the OCO3 group.

The spectrum reflects the structural complexity of the molecule, with fragmentation pathways dominated by cleavage of the benzofuran, methylenedioxy, and quinoline-like moieties. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 100 indicates minimal small-radical losses, consistent with the aromatic and heterocyclic stability of the core structure. These features collectively validate the molecular formula and provide insights into the compound’s fragmentation behavior under electron ionization."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C13H20O2 (SMILES: COCCCCCOCc1ccccc1). The spectrum displays correlations between directly bonded carbon and proton pairs, providing insights into the molecular structure. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region**: Cross-peaks in the 6.5–7.5 ppm (¹H) and 120–140 ppm (¹³C) range correspond to the aromatic protons and carbons of the benzyl group (c1ccccc1). These signals exhibit typical downfield shifts due to the deshielding effect of the aromatic ring. 2. **Methoxy Group**: A distinct cross-peak at ~3.3 ppm (¹H) and ~55 ppm (¹³C) arises from the terminal methoxy group (OCH₃). The high-field proton shift reflects the electron-donating nature of the oxygen atom. 3. **Benzyl CH₂ Group**: A correlation near 4.5 ppm (¹H) and 70 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the benzylic CH₂ group (CH₂Ph), where the proton signal is deshielded by the adjacent aromatic ring and oxygen atom. 4. **Aliphatic Chain**: Peaks in the 1.2–1.8 ppm (¹H) and 20–30 ppm (¹³C) range represent the methylene (CH₂) groups of the pentyl chain (OCH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂O). These signals align with typical alkyl shifts, with slight variations due to their proximity to electronegative oxygen atoms. 5. **Terminal CH₂ Adjacent to Oxygen**: A cross-peak near 3.5 ppm (¹H) and 65 ppm (¹³C) is attributed to the CH₂ group directly bonded to the ether oxygen (OCH₂CH₂...), showing moderate deshielding. The absence of peaks in the 9–10 ppm (¹H) and 170–220 ppm (¹³C) regions confirms the lack of aldehydic, carboxylic, or carbonyl functionalities. The spectrum’s simplicity reflects the molecule’s symmetry in the aliphatic chain and the distinct electronic environments of its functional groups. This HSQC data effectively maps the connectivity of protons to their directly bonded carbons, validating the proposed structure of COCCCCCOCc1ccccc1."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing critical insights into the molecule's structural features. The ¹H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans 0–14 ppm, while the ¹³C chemical shift axis (y-axis) ranges from 0 to -200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic region (¹H: 7–8 ppm; ¹³C: 120–150 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to the pyridine ring (c2ccc(N3CCCC3=O)cn2) and imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine moiety (n1c(=O)[nH]c2cnc3[nH]ccc3c21). These signals reflect sp²-hybridized carbons and their attached protons, with the pyridine C-2 and C-6 positions likely contributing to distinct peaks due to their unique electronic environments. 2. **Aliphatic region (¹H: 1–2 ppm; ¹³C: 20–30 ppm):** Cross-peaks here arise from the cyclohexyl-like CH2 groups in the piperidine ring (C[C@@H]1CCN...C[C@@H]1) and the pyrrolidinone ring (N3CCCC3=O). The chemical shifts suggest conformational rigidity in these saturated systems. 3. **Carbonyl region (¹³C: ~170 ppm):** A prominent ¹³C resonance near 170 ppm, with no corresponding ¹H signal, confirms the presence of the amide carbonyl (C=O) in the pyrrolidinone ring (N3CCCC3=O). This deshielded carbon lacks directly attached protons, consistent with its structure. 4. **Heteroaromatic NH correlations (¹H: 10–12 ppm; ¹³C: 100–130 ppm):** Peaks in this range likely correspond to the NH protons in the imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine system (n1c(=O)[nH]c2cnc3[nH]ccc3c21), which are hydrogen-bonded or involved in tautomeric equilibria, leading to downfield shifts. The spectrum highlights the molecule’s diverse functional groups, including aromatic systems, aliphatic chains, and amide functionalities. The spatial distribution of cross-peaks aligns with the SMILES notation, confirming the connectivity of the piperidine, pyridine, and imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine fragments. Notably, the absence of peaks in the ¹³C 50–100 ppm range suggests limited sp³-hybridized carbons beyond the aliphatic regions already noted. This HSQC spectrum serves as a foundational tool for assigning proton-carbon pairs, aiding in the elucidation of the molecule’s three-dimensional architecture and dynamic properties."

The most prominent signal appears at 4.0 ppm, which is a singlet with high intensity, likely representing the combined contributions of the ethyl ester's methylene group (-CH2O-) and the benzyl methylene (-CH2-) adjacent to the tetrazole ring. These protons are deshielded due to their proximity to electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms, respectively. A sharp singlet at 2.0 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (-CH3) on the tetrazole ring, while a smaller singlet at 2.3 ppm arises from the aromatic methyl substituent on the benzene ring.

Aromatic protons on the benzene ring (positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) manifest as overlapping multiplets between 7.0–8.0 ppm, with the most downfield signal at 8.0 ppm likely corresponding to the proton ortho to the benzyl substituent. The absence of signals below 1.0 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic protons beyond the observed methyl and methylene groups.

The spectrum displays a dominant molecular ion peak at m/z 344, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. This peak confirms the molecular formula, as the calculated mass of C12H14BrN3O2S (with bromine as 79Br) is 344.0 Da. The presence of bromine is further supported by isotope peaks at m/z 242 and 244, which exhibit a characteristic 1:1 ratio due to the natural abundance of 79Br and 81Br isotopes. These peaks likely arise from a fragment retaining the brominated triazole ring. Additional significant peaks include m/z 288, 299, 208, and 182. The peak at m/z 288 (344 – 56) suggests the loss of a C4H8 fragment, consistent with cleavage of the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) from the triazole nitrogen. The peak at m/z 299 (344 – 45) corresponds to the loss of a carboxylic acid group (COOH), likely from the thiazole-linked acetic acid side chain. The fragment at m/z 208 (288 – 80) indicates further loss of bromine (Br, 79.9 Da) from the tert-butyl-cleaved intermediate. The peak at m/z 182 may represent a stable aromatic fragment, such as the thiazole ring system (C3H3NS) combined with a carbonyl-containing moiety, though its exact structure requires further validation. Minor peaks at m/z 270 and 299 suggest additional fragmentation pathways, including possible rearrangements or losses of small neutral molecules (e.g., H2O or CO). The overall fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, particularly the labile tert-butyl and carboxylic acid groups, as well as the brominated triazole-thiazole core. The high relative abundance of the molecular ion (base peak at 344) indicates the molecule’s stability under ionization conditions, while the bromine isotope signature serves as a diagnostic marker for its presence in the structure."

The spectrum displays distinct chemical shifts corresponding to the proton environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at approximately 7.2–7.8 ppm arises from the aromatic protons of the two para-fluorophenyl rings. Each ring contributes two sets of doublets due to the electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine, which deshields adjacent protons and induces spin-spin coupling. The tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) attached to the tetrazole ring appears as a sharp singlet near 1.3 ppm, reflecting its high symmetry and lack of neighboring protons. A triplet or quartet around 4.5 ppm corresponds to the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) protons, which are deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom. The hydroxyl proton (OH) typically appears as a broad singlet between 2–3 ppm, though its exact position may vary due to hydrogen bonding. Notably, the absence of vinylic protons confirms the double bond between the hydroxymethyl-bearing carbon and the carbon linked to the tetrazole and fluorophenyl groups. The integration of peaks aligns with the molecular formula, with the tert-butyl (9H) and aromatic regions (8H) exhibiting the highest intensities, followed by the hydroxymethyl (2H) and hydroxyl (1H) signals. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the compound’s structural features, including the fluorinated aromatic systems, aliphatic substituents, and heterocyclic tetrazole ring."

The spectrum displays key features consistent with the structural motifs of this compound. The most prominent peak appears as a sharp singlet at approximately 6.0 ppm, which can be attributed to the proton on the thiazole ring (position 5 of the thiazole moiety). This downfield shift is characteristic of aromatic heterocycles, where deshielding effects from the electronegative sulfur and adjacent nitrogen atoms influence the chemical shift. A smaller, distinct singlet is observed near 11.0 ppm, likely corresponding to a highly deshielded proton in an electron-deficient environment. This may arise from the aromatic protons on the benzene ring substituted with the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group, as the strong electron-withdrawing nature of CF3 significantly deshields nearby protons, pushing their signals to higher ppm values. Additional minor peaks in the 7.0–8.0 ppm range (not explicitly resolved in the image) would typically represent remaining aromatic protons on the benzene ring, which are split into multiplets due to coupling with neighboring protons and possible meta/para substitution patterns. The absence of broad peaks in the 1–2 ppm range suggests minimal aliphatic proton contributions, though the piperazine ring’s CH2 groups (adjacent to the amide carbonyl) might appear as weak signals in the 3.0–4.0 ppm region, overlapping with the baseline noise. The methyl ester (COOCH3) would normally produce a singlet near 3.7 ppm, but this feature is either absent or obscured here, possibly due to low intensity or solvent suppression. The spectrum’s simplicity aligns with the molecule’s symmetry, particularly in the piperazine and thiazole rings, which reduce the number of unique proton environments. The CF3 group itself does not contribute to the H-NMR spectrum but exerts a strong deshielding effect on adjacent protons. Overall, the observed peaks confirm the presence of aromatic, heteroaromatic, and amide functionalities, with chemical shifts reflecting the electronic influence of fluorine and sulfur atoms."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C15H12N2O3 (SMILES: Cc1cc(N2C(=O)c3ccccc3C2=O)[n+]([O-])cc1C). The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 269, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. The base peak at m/z 269 indicates significant stability of the molecular ion under electron ionization conditions, likely due to the aromaticity and resonance stabilization of the pyridine N-oxide and phthalimide moieties. A notable peak at m/z 252 (M+ – 17) suggests the loss of a hydroxyl radical (•OH), potentially originating from the N-oxide group or a rearrangement involving the phthalimide oxygen. Fragmentation patterns reveal key structural motifs. The peak at m/z 146 corresponds to the phthalimide fragment (C8H4NO2), formed via cleavage of the N–C bond linking the phthalimide to the pyridine ring. This fragment is a hallmark of the molecule’s core structure. A strong peak at m/z 121 aligns with the pyridine N-oxide moiety retaining two methyl substituents (C7H7NO), confirming the substitution pattern on the heterocyclic ring. Additional fragments at m/z 130 and 158 may arise from rearrangements or partial degradation of the phthalimide ring, such as loss of CO or CO2 groups. Lower-abundance peaks at m/z 93, 103, and 115 are consistent with smaller aromatic hydrocarbon fragments, likely derived from the benzene ring of the phthalimide or the pyridine core. The peak at m/z 234 (M+ – 35) could indicate the elimination of a chlorine atom or a combination of small neutral species (e.g., HCN and CO), though no chlorine is present in the formula. Instead, this may reflect a complex rearrangement involving the nitro group or phthalimide. Peaks at m/z 222 and 253 further suggest stepwise degradation of the molecular ion, possibly through sequential loss of methyl or oxygen-containing groups. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern underscores the stability of the aromatic systems and the influence of the N-oxide and phthalimide groups on ionization behavior. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 90 implies that the molecule primarily fragments into larger, stabilized aromatic or heteroaromatic units rather than small aliphatic chains. This analysis aligns with the structural features of the compound, where resonance-stabilized fragments dominate the mass spectral profile."

The peaks are observed in the 1H chemical shift range of 6.1–6.5 ppm and the 13C chemical shift range of 70–150 ppm. These values suggest the presence of protonated carbons in environments influenced by electronegative groups or deshielding effects. The most downfield 13C resonance (~140 ppm) corresponds to a carbon atom likely adjacent to a carbonyl group or nitrile, as such functional groups deshield nearby carbons. The associated proton at ~6.5 ppm exhibits a relatively high chemical shift, consistent with a deshielded aliphatic or allylic proton, possibly near the ketone (C=O) or nitrile (C≡N) groups. The intermediate 13C resonance (~130 ppm) and its correlated proton (~6.3 ppm) may arise from a carbon in the vicinity of the ether oxygen (C–O) or nitrile, while the upfield 13C resonance (~120 ppm) with a proton at ~6.1 ppm could correspond to a carbon in a less deshielded aliphatic region of the ring. The molecule’s structure, a four-membered oxetane ring containing a ketone and nitrile substituent, explains the observed spectral features. The strained ring system and electron-withdrawing groups create distinct electronic environments for the protons and carbons. The absence of additional peaks aligns with the presence of only three protonated carbons in the structure: two CH2 groups and one CH group. The HSQC data effectively maps the connectivity between these protons and their attached carbons, providing insight into the molecular framework and the influence of functional groups on chemical shifts."

A sharp peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the N–H stretching vibration of the secondary amine group (NH) in the pyridazine ring, while the absence of a broad O–H stretch suggests minimal hydrogen bonding, consistent with the hydroxymethyl (–CH2OH) group’s O–H absorption being either weak or overlapping with other features. The region between 2800–3000 cm⁻¹ contains multiple peaks, including a prominent band at ~2950 cm⁻¹, indicative of C–H stretching from aromatic and aliphatic (piperidine ring) CH2 groups. The methoxy group (–OCH3) contributes to the strong absorption near 1250 cm⁻¹, corresponding to C–O stretching vibrations. Aromatic C=C stretching modes are evident in the 1450–1600 cm⁻¹ range, with distinct peaks at ~1500 and 1600 cm⁻¹, reflecting the conjugated π-systems of the benzene, naphthalene, and pyridazine rings. The tertiary amine (N–CH2–) in the piperidine moiety is associated with C–N stretching vibrations near 1100–1200 cm⁻¹, overlapping with the C–O stretch. Additionally, the sharp peak at ~1000 cm⁻¹ may correspond to in-plane bending vibrations of the aromatic C–H bonds.

The multiplet at 6.0 ppm integrates to two protons and is assigned to the diastereotopic methylene group (CH2) of the hydroxymethyl moiety, which is split by coupling with the adjacent hydroxyl-bearing methine proton (CH). The absence of additional peaks confirms the absence of impurities or solvent signals in this region. The spectrum aligns with the expected chemical shifts and splitting patterns for this substituted thiophene derivative, reflecting the influence of both the electron-withdrawing chlorine atom and the polar hydroxyl groups on the electronic environment of the protons."

The spectrum displays correlations between 1H and 13C nuclei, revealing key structural features. Prominent peaks are observed in the aromatic region, with 1H chemical shifts between 10–12 ppm and corresponding 13C shifts spanning 110–160 ppm. These signals likely arise from the thiazole and imidazole rings in the structure, as heteroaromatic systems typically exhibit deshielded protons and carbons in these ranges. The thiazole ring (containing sulfur) and imidazole substituent (-n3ccnc3) contribute to this pattern, with the sulfur atom further deshielding adjacent carbons. Additional peaks appear at 2–4 ppm (1H) and 50–70 ppm (13C), consistent with methyl groups attached to nitrogen (N-CH3). The molecule contains two equivalent methyl groups on the tertiary amine (NC1(C)C), which likely produce these signals. Notably, the carbonyl carbon (C=O) at ~160–180 ppm is absent in the HSQC spectrum, as expected, since it lacks directly bonded protons. The spectrum confirms the presence of sp2-hybridized carbons in the aromatic systems and sp3-hybridized carbons in the methyl groups, aligning with the proposed structure. This analysis underscores the utility of HSQC in mapping proton-carbon connectivity, particularly for heterocyclic compounds with diverse functional groups."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H10O2S2 (SMILES: COc1ccc2c(=O)cc(SC)sc2c1). The spectrum exhibits four distinct proton resonances, reflecting the molecule's structural features. The most downfield signal at ~12 ppm is a sharp singlet, indicative of a highly deshielded proton. This is likely the hydrogen at position 5 of the benzothiophene core, adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O) and influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of both the carbonyl and the sulfur atom. A second deshielded singlet at ~10 ppm corresponds to the proton at position 3 of the thiophene ring, which is also near the carbonyl group and experiences strong anisotropic effects from the conjugated system. The aromatic region shows a moderately intense peak at ~6 ppm, attributed to the three protons on the benzene ring (positions 6, 7, and 8). These protons are slightly shielded due to the electron-donating methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 8, which reduces their deshielding compared to typical aromatic protons. The highest-intensity signal at ~4 ppm is a singlet integrating to three protons, consistent with the methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to the benzene ring. The methylthio group (-SCH3) at position 2 of the thiophene ring appears as a singlet at ~2 ppm (not explicitly labeled in the spectrum but inferred from the molecular formula), though its signal may overlap with baseline noise or be obscured by solvent effects. The absence of signals in the 1–3 ppm range (excluding the methoxy and methylthio regions) confirms no aliphatic protons beyond the substituents. The spectrum’s simplicity reflects the molecule’s symmetry and the dominance of aromatic and functional group protons. These features align with the proposed structure, where the benzothiophene core, carbonyl group, and substituents create distinct electronic environments for each set of protons."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the structure. The spectrum exhibits distinct cross-peaks distributed across specific regions, reflecting the molecule's aromatic and heterocyclic components. In the aromatic region (¹H: 6–9 ppm; ¹³C: 100–160 ppm), multiple cross-peaks are observed, consistent with the presence of pyridine, pyrimidine, and imidazole rings in the SMILES structure. For instance, the cluster of peaks near ¹H 8.5 ppm and ¹³C 140–150 ppm corresponds to protons on the fluoropyridine ring (F-c1cnccc1), where the electronegative fluorine atom induces deshielding of adjacent protons and carbons. Additional peaks in this region (e.g., ¹H 7.5–8 ppm, ¹³C 120–135 ppm) likely arise from the pyridine and pyrimidine moieties (c1cccnc1 and nc1nc2cc...). A distinct cross-peak near ¹H 3.8 ppm and ¹³C 60 ppm is attributed to the morpholine ring's CH₂ groups (N3CCOCC3), which typically resonate in this aliphatic region. The oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the morpholine ring influence the chemical shifts of these protons and carbons, causing moderate deshielding. The absence of peaks in the carbonyl region (¹³C >160 ppm) aligns with the molecular formula, which lacks carbonyl groups. Similarly, no signals are observed in the aliphatic ¹H region (0–2 ppm), confirming the absence of isolated alkyl chains. Overall, the HSQC spectrum effectively maps the protonated carbons in this heterocyclic system, with chemical shifts reflecting the electronic effects of substituents like fluorine and morpholine. The data supports the structural features encoded in the SMILES notation, including aromaticity, heteroatom substitution, and ring connectivity."

The first cluster, located at 1H shifts of 10.5–11.0 ppm and 13C shifts of 120–140 ppm, corresponds to aromatic protons and their directly bonded carbons. These signals are characteristic of deshielded aromatic environments, likely arising from the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl (C=O) and ester (O-C=O) groups in the fused benzofuran ring system. The second cluster, centered at 1H shifts of 5.0–6.0 ppm and 13C shifts of 50–60 ppm, suggests protons on sp3-hybridized carbons, possibly from the methyl group (–CH3) attached to the benzofuran core or methylene/methine groups near electronegative substituents.

Ester C=O stretches typically appear near 1735 cm⁻¹, while amide C=O stretches occur at slightly lower wavenumbers (~1650-1690 cm⁻¹), suggesting overlapping absorptions here. Additional key features include a broad band near 1200 cm⁻¹, corresponding to C-O stretching vibrations in the ester moieties, and a medium-intensity peak at ~1370 cm⁻¹, consistent with C-H bending in the tert-butyl group.

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. Key features include: 1. **Carbonyl regions (170–200 ppm):** A prominent peak near 170 ppm corresponds to the ester carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ethyl ester group (CCOC=O). A second high-shift peak near 200 ppm arises from the ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O) adjacent to the benzyl ether (COCH2O). These shifts are consistent with sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons in electron-withdrawing environments. 2. **Aromatic region (100–150 ppm):** Multiple peaks between 120–140 ppm reflect the six aromatic carbons of the benzyl group (c1ccccc1). The splitting pattern suggests a monosubstituted benzene ring, with distinct shifts for ortho, meta, and para carbons relative to the CH2O substituent. 3. **Oxygen-adjacent aliphatic carbons (50–80 ppm):** A strong peak near 60 ppm corresponds to the methylene carbon (CH2) in the benzyl ether linkage (COCH2O), deshielded by proximity to oxygen. A nearby peak at ~55 ppm likely represents the CH2 group of the ethyl ester (OCH2CH3). 4. **Aliphatic and amine-adjacent carbons (20–50 ppm):** Peaks in this range include the methyl groups of the N,N-dimethylamino substituent (N(CH3)2, ~35 ppm) and the vinyl carbon (C=CN(CH3)2, ~45 ppm). The ethyl ester’s terminal methyl (OCH2CH3) appears as a low-intensity peak near 14 ppm, typical for sp³-hybridized methyl groups. 5. **Vinyl carbon (100–150 ppm):** A distinct peak near 100 ppm corresponds to the sp²-hybridized carbon in the enamine moiety (C=CN(CH3)2), influenced by conjugation with the adjacent carbonyl group. The spectrum’s peak multiplicities and intensities align with the molecular symmetry and electronic effects of substituents. For instance, the benzyl group’s aromatic carbons exhibit non-equivalent shifts due to the CH2O substituent, while the N,N-dimethylamino group’s methyls are equivalent, producing a single peak. The absence of peaks above 200 ppm confirms no additional carbonyl or highly deshielded carbons are present.

This peak serves as the primary indicator of the intact molecular mass. Several significant fragment ions are observed, providing insights into structural features. A cluster of peaks at m/z 289, 305, and 389 suggests sequential losses of small neutral molecules. The peak at 305 (relative abundance ~50%) likely arises from the loss of the isopropyl group (C3H7, 43 Da) from the molecular ion, yielding a stable aromatic fragment. The peak at 289 (relative abundance ~30%) may correspond to further loss of a methoxy group (CH3O, 31 Da) from the m/z 305 fragment. Notably, peaks at m/z 274, 259, and 246 indicate cleavage of the thiomorpholine ring (C4H9NS), a key structural motif in the molecule.

Lower-m/z peaks at 180, 164, and 126 are consistent with stable substructures, such as the thiomorpholine ring system (C4H9NS, m/z 119) or aromatic fragments derived from the methoxy-substituted benzene ring. The peak at m/z 112 (relative abundance ~15%) may correspond to a dimethoxyphenyl fragment (C8H10O2), supporting the presence of two methoxy groups in the parent structure. The isotopic pattern of the molecular ion peak at m/z 405 exhibits a minor [M+2]+ contribution (m/z 407), attributable to the natural abundance of sulfur-34 (4.2%) and potential minor contributions from 13C isotopes. This aligns with the molecule’s sulfur content and confirms the elemental composition. Overall, the fragmentation pattern reflects the molecule’s structural complexity, including the stability of the aromatic system, the susceptibility of the thiomorpholine ring to cleavage, and the presence of labile substituents like methoxy and isopropyl groups. These features collectively validate the assigned molecular formula and provide a detailed roadmap for structural elucidation via mass spectrometry."

The most prominent peaks are observed between 8.5–10 ppm, which correspond to deshielded protons in electron-deficient environments. The tallest peak near 9 ppm likely arises from the amide NH proton, which is strongly downfield-shifted due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. Adjacent to this, a multiplet around 8.5 ppm may represent aromatic protons on the quinoline-like heterocycle, where the proximity to nitrogen atoms reduces electron density and increases chemical shift. Aromatic protons on the substituted phenyl ring (c3ccccc3OC) appear as a series of overlapping peaks between 7–8 ppm, reflecting the splitting patterns induced by the methoxy substituent (-OC) at the meta position. The methoxy group itself generates a sharp singlet near 3.8 ppm, consistent with its typical chemical shift in electron-rich aromatic systems. Additional aliphatic signals include a triplet around 3.5 ppm (OCH2CH2N) and a quartet near 2.8 ppm (CH2N), indicative of the ethylene glycol-derived chain in the COCCN moiety. These peaks exhibit coupling patterns expected for a -OCH2CH2N- fragment. The absence of signals below 2 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic methyl groups, aligning with the molecular formula.

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C5H5N3O3 (SMILES: Cn1c([N+](=O)[O-])cnc1C=O). The spectrum displays three distinct peaks corresponding to the three unique proton environments in the molecule. The tallest peak at 6.0 ppm is assigned to the N-methyl group (3H), which appears deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent nitro and formyl groups on the aromatic ring. The singlet at 12.0 ppm corresponds to the formyl proton (1H), which is highly deshielded by the conjugated nitro group, shifting its resonance downfield. The peak at 14.0 ppm represents the aromatic proton (1H) located adjacent to the nitro group, experiencing significant deshielding from the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro substituent. The absence of additional peaks confirms the lack of other proton environments, consistent with the molecular structure. This spectrum illustrates the impact of electron-withdrawing groups on chemical shift values in aromatic heterocycles."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption features consistent with the functional groups present in this steroidal ester. A sharp, strong absorption band near 1750 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the acetyl ester group (OAc), a hallmark of ester functionalities. This peak is unambiguously attributed to the O=C-OCH₃ moiety in the structure. A broad, moderate-intensity peak around 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of O-H stretching vibrations; however, the molecular formula and SMILES indicate no hydroxyl group in the compound. This feature may arise from trace moisture in the sample or a minor impurity, as the structure contains only ether (OCH₂OCH₃) and ester oxygen atoms. The ether linkage in the OCH₂OCH₃ group contributes to the strong absorption bands in the 1000–1200 cm⁻¹ region, corresponding to C-O-C asymmetric stretching vibrations. These peaks are typical for aliphatic ethers and align with the methoxymethyl substituent in the molecule. Additional weak-to-moderate absorptions in the 2850–2950 cm⁻¹ range are assigned to C-H stretching vibrations of the aliphatic and steroid backbone, including methyl (CH₃), methylene (CH₂), and methine (CH) groups. The absence of significant peaks near 1600–1650 cm⁻¹ confirms no C=C or C=O (other than the ester) functionalities are present. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex patterns from skeletal vibrations of the steroid ring system and substituent groups, though these are less diagnostic without comparative data. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the structural features of the given molecule, emphasizing the ester carbonyl and ether functionalities, while the 3300 cm⁻¹ feature likely reflects extrinsic factors rather than the compound itself."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption bands that correlate with the functional groups and structural features of the molecule. The most prominent peak near 3400 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the N–H stretching vibration of the secondary amine in the imidazole ring, a key feature of the heterocyclic core. Additional sharp peaks around 2900 cm⁻¹ are attributed to C–H stretching vibrations from the methyl groups (–CH₃) and aromatic C–H bonds, consistent with the substituted naphthalene-like framework. A moderate band near 1600 cm⁻¹ suggests C=C stretching within the aromatic rings, while a weaker peak at ~1500 cm⁻¹ may arise from C=N stretching in the imidazole moiety. The absence of strong absorption above 3500 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of O–H or N–H groups beyond the imidazole proton. Peaks below 1000 cm⁻¹, particularly near 800 cm⁻¹, likely correspond to out-of-plane C–H bending vibrations, indicating substitution patterns on the aromatic rings. The bromine substituents (three Br atoms) do not produce distinct IR-active peaks but influence the electronic environment of adjacent bonds, subtly shifting nearby absorption frequencies. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected vibrational modes of a polybrominated, methyl-substituted imidazo-naphthalene derivative, with no evidence of carbonyl (C=O) or nitro (NO₂) groups."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C6H10O3 (SMILES: COC(=O)C(C)C(C)=O). The spectrum displays three distinct cross-peaks, each correlating proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts for directly bonded C–H pairs. The first peak at approximately 2.0 ppm (¹H) and 20 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the central CH moiety. This methyl group is adjacent to an ester carbonyl, which slightly deshields the protons, shifting them downfield relative to a typical alkyl methyl group. The second peak at ~3.0 ppm (¹H) and ~50 ppm (¹³C) arises from the methoxy group (OCH₃) of the ester functionality. The oxygen atom deshields the protons, placing them in the characteristic range for methoxy groups. The third peak at ~4.0 ppm (¹H) and ~170 ppm (¹³C) is atypical, as 170 ppm is consistent with a carbonyl carbon (C=O), which typically lacks directly attached protons. This anomaly suggests either an artifact, a long-range coupling effect, or potential overlap with a quaternary carbon resonance. The molecule’s structure (methyl 2-acetylpropanoate) includes two carbonyl groups (ester and ketone), but their carbons (expected ~170 ppm) should not produce HSQC signals. The observed peaks align with the non-carbonyl carbons: the methoxy carbon (~50 ppm), the central CH carbon (~50 ppm), and the methyl carbons (~20 ppm). The spectrum confirms the presence of the ester and ketone functionalities through indirect chemical shift correlations, though the third peak warrants further investigation to resolve its origin."

The most downfield peak at ~10.0 ppm (singlet, 1H) is attributed to the aromatic proton on the pyrimidine ring (position 5), deshielded by adjacent nitrogen atoms. A second aromatic proton on the pyrazole ring (position 4) appears as a singlet near ~9.0 ppm. The triplet at ~4.5 ppm (2H) and overlapping multiplet at ~3.5 ppm (4H) correspond to the methylene groups in the -NCH2CH2N- linker, with the former slightly more deshielded due to proximity to the pyrimidine nitrogen. Two sharp singlets at ~2.3 ppm (3H) and ~2.1 ppm (3H) represent the methyl groups on the pyrimidine (position 6) and pyrazole (position 3) rings, respectively. The broad multiplet at ~1.5 ppm integrates to 8H, consistent with the cyclopentyl protons (C2CCCC2), which exhibit complex splitting due to ring conformational dynamics. The absence of peaks in the 5–7 ppm range confirms no additional aliphatic or olefinic protons are present. This spectral pattern aligns with the proposed structure, where electron-withdrawing nitrogen atoms deshield adjacent protons, and the rigid bicyclic aromatic system restricts conformational flexibility."

The peak at m/z 314 (loss of 18 Da) suggests dehydration, likely from the carboxylic acid group (-COOH → -CO), while m/z 288 (loss of 44 Da) and 286 (loss of 46 Da) may arise from decarboxylation (-CO2) or combined losses involving small neutral molecules. Fragments at m/z 222 and 220 correspond to cleavage of the heterocyclic core, retaining portions of the pyridine and triazole rings, as evidenced by the retention of nitrogen-rich fragments. The peak at m/z 233 likely represents a stabilized aromatic fragment from the bicyclic system.

The spectrum displays correlations between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing key structural features through distinct cross-peaks. The aliphatic region (0–4 ppm in ¹H, 20–60 ppm in ¹³C) shows multiple signals corresponding to the piperidine ring (C1–C5 in the SMILES) and the tert-butyl group of the Boc protecting moiety. Notably, the tert-butyl protons appear as a singlet near 1.4 ppm, correlating with a carbon signal at ~28 ppm, consistent with the (CH₃)₃C- group. The piperidine ring protons exhibit dispersed chemical shifts (1.5–4.0 ppm), with carbons spanning 25–55 ppm, reflecting their varying electronic environments due to the adjacent sulfonyl and Boc groups. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.0 ppm in ¹H, 110–140 ppm in ¹³C), two distinct sets of cross-peaks are observed. The first set (7.5–7.8 ppm, 125–135 ppm) corresponds to the sulfonated phenyl ring (c2ccc(-c3...)cc2), with deshielding effects from the electron-withdrawing SO₂ group. The second set (7.0–7.3 ppm, 115–125 ppm) arises from the substituted phenyl ring (c3c(Cl)cc(N)cc3CF₃), where the chlorine and CF₃ groups induce characteristic downfield shifts. The CF₃ group itself does not produce HSQC signals due to the absence of directly attached protons. Additional features include a broad peak near 4.0 ppm (¹H) correlating with a carbon at ~50 ppm, likely from the N-CH₂ group adjacent to the sulfonyl moiety. The Boc carbonyl carbon (~155 ppm) lacks a corresponding proton signal, as expected. This HSQC spectrum effectively maps the molecule’s protonated carbons, confirming the presence of aliphatic, aromatic, and functionalized substructures consistent with the provided SMILES. The distribution of cross-peaks aligns with the molecular framework, validating the connectivity of the piperidine core, aryl rings, and substituents."

A broad, moderate-intensity peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O-H stretching vibration, likely from the hydroxyl group attached to the heterocyclic ring. Sharp, intense peaks at approximately 2950 cm⁻¹ correspond to C-H stretching vibrations in aliphatic regions, consistent with the methyl and methylene groups in the isobutyl substituent and ester functionalities.

The ¹H chemical shifts range from 12 to 2 ppm, while the ¹³C shifts span 180 to 20 ppm (inverted axis, with higher values toward the bottom). In the aromatic region (¹H: 6–8.5 ppm; ¹³C: 110–150 ppm), multiple cross-peaks correspond to protons and carbons in the benzene and pyridine rings. The downfield ¹H signals near 8.5 ppm (¹³C: ~145 ppm) likely arise from the pyridine ring’s H-6 and H-3 positions, influenced by the electron-withdrawing nitrogen. Additional peaks in this region (e.g., ¹H: 7.5–8 ppm; ¹³C: 130–140 ppm) reflect substituted benzene protons (e.g., H-2, H-6 in the aniline-derived aryl group) and their attached carbons.

The peak at m/z 401 (approximately 20% abundance) likely arises from the loss of ammonia (NH3, 17 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for amide-containing compounds. The fragment at m/z 356 (15% abundance) suggests cleavage of a larger neutral fragment, possibly involving the tert-butyl group (C4H9, 57 Da) and additional structural rearrangements. The cluster of peaks between m/z 206–222 (20–30% abundance) corresponds to fragments retaining the thiazole ring (S-containing heterocycle) and adjacent substituents. For example, m/z 206 may represent a thiazole-derived fragment with a carbonyl group, while m/z 220 could include additional alkyl or amine components. The peak at m/z 170 (10% abundance) may originate from the pyrazole ring (N-containing heterocycle) linked to the dimethylaminomethyl group, as suggested by the SMILES notation. The low-abundance peak at m/z 135 (5% abundance) likely reflects further fragmentation of the pyrazole or thiazole moieties.

The ¹H shifts between 7–8 ppm and ¹³C shifts of 120–140 ppm are characteristic of protonated aromatic carbons in substituted benzene rings. Peaks near ¹H 8–9 ppm and ¹³C 150–160 ppm likely arise from pyridine ring protons (e.g., H-3 or H-5 in the pyridine system), which are deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nitrogen. The presence of multiple peaks reflects the complexity of the aromatic substitution pattern, including the biphenyl-like linkage and benzyl ether group. 2. **Aliphatic Region (¹H 1–4 ppm, ¹³C 10–70 ppm):** - A cluster of peaks near ¹H 2.1 ppm and ¹³C 23 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of the N-acetyl moiety (NC(=O)CH₃), where the deshielded ¹H shift reflects its proximity to the amide carbonyl. - Peaks at ¹H 4.4 ppm and ¹³C 60 ppm are consistent with the methylene (CH₂) of the ethyl ester (COOCH₂CH₃), with the ¹H shift slightly downfield due to the electronegative oxygen. - Additional aliphatic peaks at ¹H 1.2 ppm and ¹³C 14 ppm arise from the terminal methyl of the ethyl ester, exhibiting typical shielding. - A cross-peak at ¹H 5.2 ppm and ¹³C 70 ppm likely corresponds to the benzyl methylene (OCH₂Ph), where the ¹H shift is deshielded by the adjacent oxygen and aromatic ring. 3. **Heteroatom-Substituted Carbons:** The absence of peaks in the ¹³C 160–180 ppm range confirms that carbonyl carbons (ester and amide) lack directly attached protons, as expected. The pyridine nitrogen and ether oxygen influence the chemical shifts of nearby carbons, contributing to the observed dispersion of aromatic signals. Overall, the HSQC spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, revealing correlations for all protonated carbons. The distribution of peaks reflects the molecule’s aromatic complexity, aliphatic substituents, and heteroatom effects, providing a detailed map of proton-carbon connectivity."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances characteristic of a dibenzofuran derivative with a carboxylic acid substituent. The most prominent peak at ~170 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid group, reflecting its high deshielding due to the electronegative oxygen atoms. A sharp peak at ~60 ppm is attributed to the bridgehead carbon (C1 in the SMILES notation), which is sp³-hybridized and bonded to both the oxygen atom of the furan ring and the carboxylic acid group, resulting in moderate downfield shift. The aromatic region (110–140 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks, including a cluster of three signals between 120–130 ppm and a taller singlet at ~135 ppm. These arise from the twelve aromatic carbons in the two benzene rings, with slight chemical shift differences due to their distinct positions relative to the oxygen bridge and carboxylic acid group. The symmetry of the dibenzofuran core reduces the number of unique aromatic resonances compared to a fully substituted benzene ring. No signals are observed in the aliphatic region (<60 ppm), confirming the absence of sp³-hybridized carbons beyond the bridgehead and carboxylic acid group. The spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, demonstrating the expected chemical shifts for a xanthene-based framework with a carboxyl substituent."

A minor peak at m/z 124, approximately 8% relative abundance, likely arises from the 13C isotope contribution of the fragment. Additional significant peaks at m/z 105 and 120 may correspond to further fragmentation of the aromatic or aliphatic regions, such as loss of a methyl group or rearrangement involving the brominated lactam ring. The absence of a significant isotopic pattern at m/z 286 (e.g., no observable 288 peak) indicates minimal contribution from the 81Br isotope in the molecular ion under these ionization conditions.

The spectrum displays characteristic peaks corresponding to the structural features of the molecule. The most prominent signal appears as a sharp singlet at approximately 2.0 ppm, which is consistent with methylene (CH2) protons adjacent to the hydroxyl group (C3 position). This deshielding effect arises from the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen atom. A smaller, broad peak near 3.5 ppm likely corresponds to the hydroxyl-bearing methine proton (CH-OH), though the hydroxyl proton itself is not distinctly visible, possibly due to rapid exchange or broadening. In the alkene region, a multiplet at ~5.5 ppm is observed, assignable to the vinyl protons (C1 and C2 positions) of the terminal double bond. The splitting pattern here suggests coupling between the two vinylic protons and potential allylic coupling with adjacent methylene protons. A minor peak at ~1.0 ppm corresponds to the terminal methyl group (CH3) at the end of the long aliphatic chain, which is shielded due to its distance from electronegative groups. Additional minor peaks between 1.2–1.5 ppm represent methylene protons (CH2) in the extended aliphatic chain, which typically resonate in this region. The absence of significant signals above 6 ppm indicates no aromatic or strongly deshielded protons are present. The spectrum aligns with the expected structure, highlighting the presence of a hydroxyl group, a terminal double bond, and a long aliphatic tail. Integration ratios and peak multiplicities further support the molecular framework, though precise quantification would require calibrated integration data."

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to key functional groups in the structure. A prominent sharp peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibrations of the thiazolidinedione ring, consistent with the conjugated lactam and ketone functionalities. A strong, broad absorption near 1320 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the asymmetric stretching of the sulfonamide (S=O) group, while a weaker band at ~1150 cm⁻¹ aligns with symmetric S=O stretching. The region between 1600–1450 cm⁻¹ displays multiple peaks, indicative of aromatic C=C stretching from the fused pyridine-furan system and the piperazine-linked aromatic core. A distinct band at ~1250 cm⁻¹ likely arises from C-O stretching in the furan ring or C-N vibrations in the piperazine moiety. The N-H stretching of the sulfonamide group appears as a moderate broad peak near 3300 cm⁻¹, overlapping with potential aromatic C-H stretches. Additional features in the fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) include C-S stretching (~700–750 cm⁻¹) and out-of-plane deformations of the heterocyclic rings.

The spectrum displays correlations between proton (1H) and directly bonded carbon (13C) nuclei, with the horizontal axis representing 1H chemical shifts (ppm) and the vertical axis representing 13C chemical shifts (ppm). Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (1H 6.5–8.5 ppm, 13C 110–140 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks are observed in this region, consistent with the presence of aromatic protons and their attached carbons. The benzene rings in the molecule (from the phenyl and oxazole substituents) contribute to these signals. The oxazole ring’s proton (adjacent to nitrogen) likely appears as a distinct peak near 1H ~7.5 ppm and 13C ~125 ppm, while the phenyl ring protons (e.g., from the benzyl group) span a broader range due to substitution effects. 2. **Aliphatic Region (1H 0.5–3.5 ppm, 13C 10–60 ppm):** A cluster of peaks in this region corresponds to the aliphatic protons and their bonded carbons. The methyl group (C28H34N2O4) attached to the oxazole ring is evident as a cross-peak near 1H ~2.3 ppm and 13C ~12 ppm. The morpholine-like ring (O[C@@H]3CCC[C@H]C3) contributes peaks for CH2 groups, with shifts around 1H 1.5–2.0 ppm and 13C 20–30 ppm. The CH2 adjacent to the nitrogen (CN) appears slightly downfield (1H ~2.8 ppm, 13C ~50 ppm) due to deshielding by the electronegative nitrogen. 3. **Oxygenated Carbon Region (13C 60–80 ppm):** Peaks in this range correspond to carbons bonded to oxygen, such as the ether carbon (CO) in the morpholine ring. The cross-peak near 13C ~65 ppm and 1H ~3.4 ppm likely arises from the CH2O group, reflecting the deshielding effect of the oxygen atom. 4. **Absence of Carbonyl Correlation:** The carboxylic acid group (CC(=O)O) does not produce a cross-peak in the HSQC spectrum because the carbonyl carbon lacks a directly attached proton. However, the adjacent CH2 group (from the acetic acid moiety) may appear as a weak cross-peak near 1H ~2.5 ppm and 13C ~35 ppm. The spectrum illustrates the structural complexity of the molecule, with distinct correlations for aromatic, aliphatic, and oxygenated environments. These features align with the provided SMILES notation, confirming the presence of functional groups such as benzene rings, an oxazole heterocycle, a morpholine-like ring, and a carboxylic acid substituent. The HSQC data aids in assigning protonated carbons, enabling detailed mapping of the molecule’s connectivity and electronic environment."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks corresponding to the unique carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at approximately 120 ppm arises from the aromatic carbons of the two phenyl rings (c1ccccc1), which dominate the spectrum due to their high electron density and symmetry. These carbons typically resonate between 110–160 ppm, and their overlapping signals here suggest similar chemical environments across both rings. A sharp, intense peak near 190 ppm is consistent with the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ketone group, which is highly deshielded due to the electronegativity of oxygen and the double bond. This shift aligns with typical ketone carbonyl resonances (180–220 ppm). Additional peaks at ~80 ppm, ~60 ppm, and ~50 ppm correspond to the central quaternary carbon, the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH), and the methoxy (OCH3) group, respectively. The central carbon, bonded to two oxygen atoms and two aryl groups, appears downfield (~80 ppm) due to strong deshielding. The hydroxymethyl carbon (~60 ppm) is slightly shielded compared to the central carbon but remains deshielded by the adjacent oxygen. The methoxy group (~50 ppm) exhibits a relatively shielded environment, typical for alkoxy methyl carbons. The spectrum lacks significant splitting, as expected for proton-decoupled C-NMR, and the relative intensities reflect the number of equivalent carbons: the aromatic peak (12 carbons) is the tallest, followed by the single-carbon signals. This analysis confirms the structural features of the molecule, including the ketone, aromatic rings, and oxygenated substituents."

The absence of significant peaks above m/z 332 confirms the molecular weight, and the distribution of fragments aligns with the structure’s ester and carbamate functionalities. This fragmentation pattern is consistent with the proposed SMILES notation, highlighting the stability of the Boc-protected amine and the susceptibility of ester bonds to cleavage under mass spectrometric conditions."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption bands corresponding to key functional groups in the molecule. A broad, intense peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of N–H stretching vibrations, likely from the amide (C(N)=O) and urea (NCON) groups, with hydrogen bonding contributing to the broadness. A sharp peak at ~2900 cm⁻¹ corresponds to C–H stretching in aliphatic chains, consistent with the pentyl (NCCCCCN) and isopropyl (NC(C)C) substituents. The strong absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to carbonyl (C=O) stretching in the amide and urea functionalities, with slight shifts due to conjugation or hydrogen bonding. Peaks in the 1600–1500 cm⁻¹ region arise from N–H bending vibrations (amide II bands) and aromatic C=C stretching from the fluorinated benzene ring. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex patterns, including C–F stretching vibrations near 1100–1000 cm⁻¹ (from the two fluorine atoms on the aromatic ring) and C–O stretching from the ether linkage (COc2nsc...). Additional bands in the 1200–1000 cm⁻¹ range may reflect C–N stretching or S–C vibrations from the thiazole ring (nsc). The absence of sharp peaks above 3500 cm⁻¹ confirms no free O–H groups, while the lack of signals near 2200 cm⁻¹ rules out nitriles or alkynes. This spectral profile aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including its aromatic fluorination, amide/urea motifs, and aliphatic side chains."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 12 to 6 ppm, reflecting the diverse proton environments in this heterocyclic sulfonamide compound. The most prominent feature is a high-intensity singlet at 6.0 ppm, likely corresponding to the combined methyl groups attached to nitrogen and sulfur atoms (N-CH3 and S-CH3). These groups are electronically deshielded by adjacent electronegative atoms, shifting their signals downfield relative to typical aliphatic protons. Additional aromatic protons are evident in the 8.0–11.0 ppm region. A singlet at 10.5 ppm may arise from the NH proton of the urea linkage (NHC(=O)N), which is strongly deshielded by hydrogen bonding and adjacent carbonyl groups. A doublet or multiplet near 8.5 ppm could correspond to pyridine ring protons (from the c2ncccc2 fragment), while a peak at 11.0 ppm might represent a sulfonamide NH proton (NHSO2), further deshielded by the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group. The pyrimidine ring (n1c(OC)cc(OC)nc1N) contributes to the aromatic region, with methoxy-substituted carbons reducing the electron density on adjacent protons, potentially shifting their signals to ~7.5–8.5 ppm. The absence of peaks below 6 ppm suggests that methoxy protons (OCH3) are either obscured by baseline noise or overlap with the intense methyl signals. The spectrum’s simplicity in the aliphatic region (no multiplets or coupling patterns) aligns with the molecule’s symmetry and lack of complex spin-spin interactions. Overall, the H-NMR data confirm the presence of aromatic heterocycles, sulfonamide and urea functionalities, and multiple methyl substituents, consistent with the proposed structure."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides a two-dimensional correlation between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbon environments. The spectrum displays distinct clusters of cross-peaks that reflect the molecule's structural motifs. In the aliphatic region (¹H: 0–4 ppm; ¹³C: 10–60 ppm), several cross-peaks are observed. These correspond to the methyl (CH₃) and methylene (CH₂) groups from the isoleucine-derived side chains (e.g., the [C@H](C)CC fragments) and the glycerol backbone (OCH₂CH(OCH₃)CH₂O). The methyl groups typically appear as intense peaks near 0.8–1.2 ppm in ¹H and 10–20 ppm in ¹³C, consistent with their deshielded environments. The methylene protons adjacent to oxygen atoms (e.g., in the glycerol moiety) exhibit downfield shifts (¹H: ~3.5–4.0 ppm; ¹³C: ~60–70 ppm), reflecting their proximity to electronegative atoms. Aromatic and heteroaromatic regions are evident in the ¹H range of 6–8 ppm and ¹³C range of 100–160 ppm. The pyrimidone ring (n1ccc(N)nc1=O) contributes distinct cross-peaks: the C5-H and C6-H protons of the uracil-like moiety appear near 7.5–8.0 ppm (¹H) and correlate with carbons at ~140–150 ppm (¹³C). The exocyclic amine (NH₂) on the pyrimidine ring does not produce HSQC signals, as nitrogen-bound protons are not detected in standard HSQC experiments. Carbonyl regions (¹³C: 160–180 ppm) lack direct HSQC correlations, as carbonyl carbons are not protonated. However, the ester carbonyls (C=O) in the [C@@H](N)[C@@H](C)CC fragments are inferred from the absence of peaks in this region, consistent with their non-protonated nature. The spectrum also reveals a sparse distribution of peaks in the downfield ¹H region (10–12 ppm), likely corresponding to exchangeable protons from amide NH groups (e.g., in the isoleucine residues), though these are often broadened or absent in HSQC due to rapid exchange. Overall, the HSQC spectrum aligns with the molecule’s structural features, including aliphatic side chains, a glycerol backbone, and a pyrimidone heterocycle. The correlations provide critical insights into the protonated carbon framework, aiding in the assignment of functional groups and stereochemical elements."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing critical insights into the molecular structure. The ¹H dimension spans 14–0 ppm (x-axis), while the ¹³C dimension spans 0–200 ppm (y-axis). Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (7–8 ppm, 120–140 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this area correspond to the two chlorinated phenyl rings. The ¹H shifts near 7.2–7.5 ppm and ¹³C shifts at ~128–132 ppm are consistent with aromatic carbons bearing electron-withdrawing Cl substituents, which deshield adjacent protons and carbons. 2. **Vinyl Group (5–6 ppm, 110–130 ppm):** A distinct cross-peak pair near 5.8 ppm (¹H) and ~130 ppm (¹³C) arises from the terminal alkene (C=CC), with the sp²-hybridized carbons and vinylic protons showing characteristic downfield shifts. 3. **Cyclopropane Ring (0.5–1.5 ppm, 10–30 ppm):** Peaks in this region correlate to the cyclopropyl group (C2CC2). The upfield ¹H shifts (0.7–1.2 ppm) and ¹³C shifts (~20–25 ppm) reflect the strained ring’s electron-rich environment and small dihedral angles. 4. **Hydroxymethyl Group (3.5–4.0 ppm, 60–70 ppm):** A cross-peak at ~3.8 ppm (¹H) and ~65 ppm (¹³C) matches the CH₂OH moiety, where the oxygen atom deshields the adjacent protons and carbons. 5. **Aliphatic Region (1.0–2.5 ppm, 20–60 ppm):** Peaks here correspond to the lactam ring’s aliphatic carbons (e.g., C@H and C@@H positions) and the quaternary carbon (C1) adjacent to the carbonyl. The ¹³C shifts near 45–55 ppm suggest carbons bonded to electronegative nitrogen or oxygen. Notably, the absence of peaks near 170–180 ppm (¹³C) confirms the lactam carbonyl (C1=O) lacks directly attached protons, consistent with its structure. The HSQC data effectively maps the molecule’s protonated carbons, validating the connectivity of aromatic, vinylic, and aliphatic domains as defined by the SMILES notation. This analysis underscores the utility of HSQC in resolving complex molecular frameworks through heteronuclear correlation."

The peak at m/z 247 (264 - 17) suggests the loss of a hydroxyl radical (•OH), likely originating from the methoxy group (-OCH3) or the tetrahydrofuran ring. The fragment at m/z 250 (264 - 14) corresponds to the loss of a methylene group (CH2), which may arise from cleavage of the aliphatic chain adjacent to the aromatic ring. The ion at m/z 139 could represent a fragment retaining the fluorinated aromatic ring and part of the aliphatic chain, while the peak at m/z 125 (139 - 14) further supports sequential CH2 loss. The ion at m/z 108 aligns with a methoxyphenyl fragment (C7H7O+), consistent with the presence of a 4-fluoromethoxybenzene moiety. The peak at m/z 97 may correspond to a nitrile-containing fragment (C4H4FN+), reflecting cleavage of the tetrahydrofuran ring and retention of the -CC#N group. Additional peaks at m/z 208 and 209 suggest larger fragments involving the aromatic and oxygenated portions of the molecule.

The highest-intensity peak near 190 ppm corresponds to the ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the pyranone ring, which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen atom. A secondary peak around 165 ppm is attributed to the ester carbonyl carbon (OC=O) linked to the phenyl group, which is slightly less deshielded than the ketone. The aromatic region shows multiple resonances between 120–150 ppm, representing the six carbons of the phenyl ring and the two olefinic carbons in the pyranone ring. These shifts are consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons in conjugated systems, with substituents (e.g., the ester group) causing further deshielding. A distinct peak near 50 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the pyranone ring, which appears upfield due to its sp³ hybridization and lack of direct conjugation. Additional peaks in the 100–120 ppm range likely arise from the oxygenated quaternary carbon in the pyranone ring and the carbon adjacent to the ester linkage. The spectrum’s peak distribution aligns with the 13 unique carbon environments in the molecule, though some overlap may occur due to similar chemical shifts in the aromatic region.

The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at ~13.0 ppm, corresponding to the acidic pyrazole NH proton (N-H of the [nH] group in the SMILES), which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent nitrogen atoms. A second singlet at ~11.0 ppm likely arises from the secondary amine proton (N-H of the -NH- group linking the quinoline and pyrazole moieties), also deshielded by conjugation. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed.

The furan ring (c3ccoc3) contributes to the peaks near ~7.0–7.2 ppm, with coupling patterns reflecting its heteroaromatic structure. In the aliphatic region, a triplet at ~3.8 ppm and a quartet at ~3.2 ppm suggest the presence of two distinct CH2 groups adjacent to the thiazolidine ring’s nitrogen and sulfur atoms. These protons are deshielded by the electron-withdrawing sulfone (S(=O)2) group and the ring’s heteroatoms. The absence of peaks below 2 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic methyl groups, aligning with the molecular formula. Additionally, a broad peak near ~10 ppm may correspond to the NH proton of the thiazolidine ring, though its exact assignment is challenging due to potential exchange broadening.

The fluorine atom at position 5 induces a strong deshielding effect, shifting these protons downfield. The doublet at 8.5 ppm corresponds to the proton adjacent to fluorine (position 4), split by the fluorine nucleus (¹⁹F, I=½) via ³JHF coupling (~50–60 Hz). The triplet at 7.8 ppm arises from the proton at position 6, coupled to both the fluorine and the adjacent aromatic proton (positions 4 and 5).

(3) Peaks in the aliphatic region (¹H 1–3 ppm, ¹³C 20–40 ppm) attributable to the isopropyl group (CC(C)C(=O)), with the methyl groups appearing as a doublet near ~1.2 ppm (¹H) and ~20 ppm (¹³C), and the methine proton at ~2.5 ppm (¹H) and ~30 ppm (¹³C). (4) The absence of peaks in the ¹³C 160–180 ppm region reflects the lack of directly observable carbonyl carbons (C=O), as these do not bear protons. The spectrum confirms the presence of all protonated carbons in the structure, with chemical shifts aligning with the expected electronic effects of electronegative substituents (F, I) and conjugated aromatic systems. Peak dispersion suggests minimal overlap, indicative of a well-resolved experiment."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C13H28O (SMILES: CC(C)CCCC(C)CCC(C)(C)O). The spectrum displays distinct peaks in the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm) and a prominent resonance near 70 ppm, consistent with the structural features of a branched tertiary alcohol. The most downfield signal at ~70 ppm corresponds to the quaternary carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (C-OH), which typically appears in this region due to deshielding by electronegative oxygen. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~35 ppm likely represents the methine carbon (CH) directly bonded to the hydroxyl-bearing carbon, reflecting its slightly deshielded environment. Several peaks in the 20–40 ppm range (e.g., ~25, 30 ppm) are assignable to methylene (CH₂) and methyl (CH₃) carbons in the alkyl chain. The intense peak at ~25 ppm may correspond to equivalent methyl groups (e.g., the two terminal CH₃ groups in the isopropyl moiety), while signals near 30 ppm could arise from methylene carbons in the central chain. The absence of peaks above 100 ppm confirms the lack of sp²-hybridized carbons (e.g., carbonyls or aromatics), aligning with the saturated structure. Notably, the spectrum exhibits fewer than 13 distinct peaks, indicating symmetry in the molecule. For example, the two methyl groups on the quaternary carbon (C-OH) are chemically equivalent, merging into a single resonance. Similarly, the two terminal methyls in the isopropyl group (CH(CH₃)₂) produce a shared signal. This symmetry simplifies the spectral pattern despite the molecule’s moderate size. The overall chemical shift distribution and peak intensities support the assigned structure, with aliphatic carbons dominating the spectrum and a clear signature for the tertiary alcohol functionality. This analysis underscores the utility of C-NMR in elucidating structural motifs through characteristic carbon environments."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 233, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. The base peak (most intense signal) appears at m/z 112, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 91, 103, 120, 121, 171, 188, and 216, with relative abundances decreasing progressively from the base peak. The molecular ion peak (233) confirms the molecular formula C15H24N2, as calculated from the exact mass. The base peak at 112 suggests a dominant fragmentation pathway involving cleavage of the cyclopentane ring (C5H8) from the dimethylamino-benzyl substituent. The m/z 91 peak is characteristic of a tropylium ion (C7H7⁺), commonly observed in aromatic systems, supporting the presence of the benzyl group (Cc2ccccc2) in the structure. The m/z 120 peak likely arises from a loss of a methyl group (CH3, 15 Da) from the molecular ion, while the m/z 121 peak may represent an isotope contribution or a distinct fragmentation product. The m/z 171 peak corresponds to a loss of 62 Da (C4H10N) from the molecular ion, potentially representing cleavage of the dimethylamino group and adjacent carbon atoms. The m/z 188 and 216 peaks suggest partial retention of the aromatic and aliphatic framework, with incremental mass losses consistent with sequential fragmentation of the cyclopentane ring or side-chain scission. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 233 confirms the molecular ion’s stability and the absence of higher-mass impurities. These spectral features align with the proposed structure, where the cyclopentane ring (C1CCCC1) and dimethylamino group (N(C)C) contribute to fragmentation patterns typical of tertiary amines and alkyl-substituted aromatics. The spectrum provides strong evidence for the molecular architecture, with diagnostic peaks supporting both the core structure and substituent groups."

The spectrum displays several key features consistent with the structure of 4-hydroxycyclohexylacetic acid. The most prominent peak appears at approximately 12.5 ppm as a singlet, corresponding to the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group. Adjacent to this, a triplet at 4.0 ppm (integration ~1H) is observed, likely representing the proton on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (-CH(OH)-) in the cyclohexane ring. This signal is split by coupling with neighboring protons. A multiplet centered at 3.6 ppm (integration ~1H) and a singlet at 2.3 ppm (integration ~2H) are also present. The 3.6 ppm signal corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the hydroxyl-substituted carbon, while the 2.3 ppm singlet arises from the methylene group (-CH2-) directly attached to the carboxylic acid moiety. These protons appear upfield of the carboxylic acid proton due to reduced deshielding effects. In the aliphatic region (1.0–2.0 ppm), overlapping multiplets are observed, reflecting the complex splitting patterns of the cyclohexane ring protons. The peaks at 1.6 ppm (broad multiplet, integration ~4H) and 1.2 ppm (narrow multiplet, integration ~2H) correspond to the axial and equatorial protons of the cyclohexane ring, which exhibit distinct chemical shifts due to ring conformational dynamics. The absence of aromatic signals (6.5–8.0 ppm) confirms the lack of unsaturated carbons in the structure, while the lack of signals above 14 ppm or below -2 ppm indicates no unusual shielding or deshielding environments. The integration ratios align with the molecular formula, supporting the assignment of 8 carbons, 14 hydrogens, and 3 oxygens. Overall, the spectrum demonstrates characteristic features of a cyclohexane derivative with hydroxyl and carboxylic acid functional groups, consistent with the provided SMILES notation."

The most downfield peak at ~160 ppm corresponds to the aromatic carbon directly bonded to the fluorine atom (C–F), which experiences significant deshielding due to the electronegativity of fluorine. Two adjacent aromatic carbons (ortho and para to fluorine) appear as a peak near ~130 ppm, while the meta-substituted aromatic carbons resonate at ~115 ppm, consistent with typical fluorobenzene substitution patterns. The peak at ~70 ppm arises from the oxygen-bearing carbon (CH2–O) in the morpholine-like ring, which is deshielded by the electronegative oxygen. The nitrogen-bearing carbon (CH2–N) in the same ring appears at ~50 ppm, reflecting moderate deshielding. A peak at ~30 ppm corresponds to the aliphatic CH2 group adjacent to the methyl substituent, while the methyl group itself (CH3) resonates at ~20 ppm, typical for alkyl carbons. Notably, the spectrum lacks splitting patterns, suggesting fluorine–carbon coupling is either absent or unresolved, likely due to the quaternary nature of the C–F bond. The absence of additional peaks indicates symmetry in the aromatic ring and ring system, reducing the number of unique carbon environments. The TMS reference peak at 0 ppm confirms calibration accuracy. This spectral data aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting key features of the aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic regions."

The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 344, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 343 Da. The base peak at m/z 156 indicates a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the amide bond adjacent to the bicyclic system, yielding a fragment containing the pyrroloindole core (C11H10N2O) with a mass of 156 Da. This fragment’s dominance suggests resonance stabilization from the aromatic bicyclic structure. Key fragment ions include m/z 132 and 145, which may correspond to sequential losses of small neutral species (e.g., CO or CH2) from the pyrroloindole fragment. The peak at m/z 145 could represent the indole-derived fragment (C10H9N) with an additional carbonyl group (CO), while m/z 132 may reflect further dehydrogenation or loss of a methyl group. The cluster of peaks at m/z 184, 185, and 183 likely originates from the pyrroloindole system with retained substituents, such as the amide-linked hexanoic acid chain, undergoing partial fragmentation. The peak at m/z 241 suggests a larger fragment retaining the bicyclic core and part of the aliphatic chain, possibly via cleavage of the hydroxamic acid group (NO). The peak at m/z 326 corresponds to the molecular ion minus water (344 – 18), indicative of dehydration, a common process in hydroxamic acid-containing compounds. Additional peaks at m/z 311 and 312 may arise from loss of NO (30 Da) or HNO (31 Da) from the molecular ion, reflecting the lability of the hydroxamic acid moiety. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule: the pyrroloindole core contributes to stable aromatic fragments (e.g., m/z 156), while the flexible aliphatic chain and hydroxamic acid group generate variable neutral losses (H2O, NO). The absence of significant peaks above m/z 344 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity, and the distribution of fragment ions provides insight into the molecule’s structural motifs, particularly the robustness of the bicyclic system and the reactivity of the hydroxamic acid terminus."

The peak at m/z 391 suggests a loss of 56 Da from the molecular ion, likely representing the cleavage of a butyl fragment (C4H8) from the tert-butyl substituent on the benzene ring. This is consistent with the stability of the tert-butyl cation and common fragmentation pathways in alkyl-substituted aromatic systems. A notable peak at m/z 160 may arise from the fragmentation of the phthalimide moiety (C8H4NO2, 146 Da) with additional contributions from adjacent structural elements, such as the loss of a carbonyl group or rearrangement. The cluster of peaks at m/z 215, 230, 244, and 245 indicates the presence of stable fragments containing the chlorinated pyridone ring (C5H3ClNO, 129 Da) and/or the phthalimide group. These fragments likely retain the chlorine atom, as evidenced by the spacing of 15–16 Da between some peaks, which may correspond to the loss or retention of oxygen or nitrogen-containing groups. The peaks at m/z 286, 300, and 315 further suggest stepwise degradation of the molecule, potentially involving the elimination of small neutral species like CO (28 Da) or HCN (27 Da) from the phthalimide or pyridone rings. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 447 confirms the absence of dimerization or adduct formation under the ionization conditions. The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural complexity of the molecule, particularly the presence of labile bonds at the central alkene linkage (/C=C\\) and the electron-withdrawing phthalimide and pyridone groups, which stabilize charge localization during ionization. This spectrum exemplifies typical behavior of heterocyclic and aromatic systems under mass spectrometric analysis, where cleavage at branching points and heteroatom-rich regions dominates the fragmentation profile."

The molecular ion peak at m/z 471 (100% relative abundance) corresponds to the intact molecule, confirming the molecular weight of 470.54 g/mol calculated from the formula C24H26N2O6S. Fragmentation patterns reveal structurally significant ions: 1. **Base peak at m/z 333**: This dominant peak suggests a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the sulfone-containing aryl ether (Oc4ccc(S(C)(=O)=O)cc4) and loss of the sulfonic acid group (–SO3H, 80 Da). The remaining fragment (471 – 80 = 391) may undergo further rearrangement or dehydration to yield m/z 333. 2. **High-mass fragments (m/z 412, 453)**: The peak at m/z 453 (17% abundance) corresponds to the loss of water (H2O, 18 Da) from the molecular ion, indicating the presence of hydroxyl or hemiacetal functionalities in the molecule. The peak at m/z 412 (12% abundance) may result from the elimination of the sulfone group (–SO2, 64 Da) or a combined loss of SO2 and CH3OH (64 + 32 = 96 Da). 3. **Mid-range fragments (m/z 235–386)**: Peaks at m/z 235, 249, and 290 (all <20% abundance) likely originate from cleavage of the central aromatic system or the oxazoline ring (C@H1CN=C(O1)). For instance, m/z 290 could represent a fragment retaining the oxazoline and one aryl group, while m/z 235 may correspond to a benzofuran-like structure formed via cyclization and loss of the sulfone moiety. 4. **Sulfur isotopic signature**: The molecular ion peak at m/z 471 shows a minor shoulder at m/z 473, consistent with the natural abundance of 34S (4.2%), confirming the presence of sulfur in the molecule. The observed fragmentation aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the sulfone group (S(C)(=O)=O), the oxazoline ring, and the multiple aromatic ethers. The high stability of the m/z 333 fragment suggests retention of the core heterocyclic system, while the loss of polar substituents (e.g., SO3H, H2O) reflects the molecule’s susceptibility to cleavage under electron ionization conditions.

Peaks at m/z 109 and 172 may arise from cleavage of the alkyl chain or retention of the isopropylamino group (C₃H₈N⁺, 58 Da) attached to the thioether. The presence of peaks at m/z 193 and 229 indicates intermediate fragments retaining portions of the aromatic ring and sulfonamide group. The peak at m/z 272, adjacent to the base peak, likely reflects the natural abundance of the ³⁴S isotope (≈4.2% for each sulfur atom), consistent with the molecule’s two sulfur atoms. These spectral features collectively align with the proposed structure, highlighting key fragmentation pathways involving the thioether, sulfonamide, and aromatic components."

The base peak at m/z 207 dominates the spectrum, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. This fragment likely arises from cleavage of the C3-phenyl bond in the chromanone core, yielding a cationic fragment comprising the propyl-substituted chromanone moiety (C12H15O3, calculated m/z 207). Additional significant peaks include m/z 343, 271, 327, and 344. The peak at m/z 343 (Δm/z = –32 from [M+H]+) suggests loss of methanol (CH3OH), a common fragmentation pathway for ethers or esters, consistent with the presence of multiple methoxy (–OCH3) groups in the structure. The peak at m/z 271 may represent a fragment retaining the phenyl ring with partial methoxy substitution (e.g., loss of the propyl-chromanone portion).

The spectrum also exhibits a cluster of mid-intensity peaks between m/z 150–200, including 154, 175, and 193, which may derive from further breakdown of the chromanone core or phenyl-methoxy fragments. For instance, m/z 175 could represent a trimethoxyphenyl cation (C9H11O3+, calculated m/z 175), formed by cleavage of the propyl chain and chromanone ring. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 100 suggests limited small-molecule elimination (e.g., CO, H2O) under the ionization conditions. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of C21H26O6, particularly the labile C3-phenyl bond and the stability of oxygenated aromatic fragments. The dominance of the m/z 207 ion underscores the propensity of the chromanone core to stabilize charge following bond cleavage, a hallmark of electron ionization in oxygen-rich heterocycles."

The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at approximately 2.0 ppm with high intensity, which is attributed to the nine equivalent protons of the tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) attached to the aromatic ring. This group typically appears as a singlet due to its symmetrical environment. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.0 ppm), multiple peaks of moderate intensity are observed, reflecting the eight aromatic protons from the two substituted benzene rings. The ring bearing the hydroxyl group (-c2cccc(O)c2) likely contributes to signals in the 6.7–7.2 ppm range, as hydroxyl substitution deshields adjacent protons. The second aromatic ring, substituted with both the methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) and tert-butyl groups, generates signals in the 7.2–8.0 ppm range due to the electron-withdrawing effects of these substituents, which further deshield the ring protons. A distinct singlet at ~6.0 ppm corresponds to the three protons of the methoxy group (-OCH3) in the ester moiety. This singlet is slightly downfield compared to typical methoxy signals (usually ~3.8 ppm), likely due to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group adjacent to the oxygen. Notably, the hydroxyl proton (-OH) on the second aromatic ring is not prominently visible in this spectrum, which is common in H-NMR due to rapid exchange with trace water or solvent, leading to broadening or disappearance of the signal. The integration of peaks aligns with the molecular structure: the tert-butyl singlet (9H) dominates the spectrum, while the aromatic region and methoxy group account for the remaining protons.

A small singlet near 12 ppm is consistent with the carboxylic acid proton (COOH), which typically resonates between 10–13 ppm due to strong deshielding. The aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm) exhibits multiple low-intensity peaks, likely representing the substituted benzene rings in the structure. These signals are split into complex multiplets due to spin-spin coupling between aromatic protons and possibly overlapping with signals from the bicyclic system. A minor peak at ~6 ppm could correspond to a proton on the quaternary carbon adjacent to the aromatic ring (e.g., the C2 position in the bicyclic framework), while the weak signal at ~10 ppm might reflect an aldehydic or highly deshielded aromatic proton, though its assignment is less certain. The absence of broad multiplets in the 1–3 ppm range suggests minimal contribution from aliphatic CH2 or CH3 groups beyond the N-methyl and tert-butyl (CC2(C)C) moieties, which may overlap with other signals.

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C7H4ClIO2 (SMILES: O=C(O)c1c(Cl)cccc1I). The spectrum displays three distinct peaks in the aromatic region, centered near 10.5 ppm, 11.0 ppm, and 12.0 ppm. These high chemical shift values are characteristic of protons in a strongly deshielded environment, consistent with the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents (Cl, I, and the carboxylic acid group) on the benzene ring. The molecule contains three aromatic protons (positions 3, 4, and 5 in the ring), which are non-equivalent due to the asymmetric substitution pattern (Cl at position 2, I at position 6, and COOH at position 1). This lack of symmetry results in three separate signals. The carboxylic acid proton (COOH) is not distinctly observed, likely due to rapid exchange with residual water or deuterated solvent (e.g., DMSO-d6 or D2O), which suppresses its signal. The peaks’ sharpness suggests minimal quadrupolar broadening from iodine, and their integration would typically correspond to one proton each. The absence of coupling patterns (e.g., doublets or triplets) may indicate either unresolved splitting or the influence of solvent effects on spectral resolution. Overall, the spectrum reflects a highly substituted aromatic system with deshielded protons, aligning with the molecular structure provided."

The spectrum displays characteristic proton resonances consistent with the structural features of the compound. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, including a singlet at ~7.8 ppm corresponding to the oxazole ring proton (H-4), which is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Two multiplets at ~7.5 ppm and ~7.2 ppm arise from the aromatic protons of the benzamide (H-2', H-6') and difluoromethoxy-substituted phenyl ring (H-2'', H-6''), respectively, with the latter slightly upfield due to the electron-donating isopropoxy group. A singlet at ~6.9 ppm integrates to two protons and is assigned to the symmetrically substituted H-3'' and H-5'' on the phenyl ring bearing the OCH(F)₂ group. In the aliphatic region, a triplet at ~4.4 ppm (J = 7.0 Hz) corresponds to the CH₂ group of the ethoxy moiety (H-1'''), split by coupling with the adjacent methyl protons. A doublet at ~3.8 ppm (J = 6.0 Hz) integrates to two protons and is attributed to the methylene group (H-7) adjacent to the amide nitrogen. A multiplet at ~3.5 ppm represents the methine proton (H-8''') of the isopropoxy group, while two doublets at ~1.3 ppm (J = 6.0 Hz) and ~1.2 ppm (J = 7.0 Hz) correspond to the methyl groups of the isopropoxy (H-9''') and ethoxy (H-2''') substituents, respectively. The absence of signals below 2 ppm confirms the lack of additional aliphatic protons, and the high-field region (<2 ppm) shows no significant peaks, consistent with the absence of long-chain alkyl groups. The integration ratios and splitting patterns align with the molecular symmetry and substitution pattern of the aromatic rings. Notably, the difluoromethoxy group (OCHF₂) does not produce resolvable splitting in the aromatic proton signals due to weak ¹⁹F-¹H coupling or rapid relaxation of fluorine nuclei. Overall, the spectrum reflects the distinct electronic environments of protons in this heterocyclic compound, with key resonances validating the presence of aromatic, amide, ether, and oxazole functionalities."

The spectrum exhibits distinct peaks corresponding to the structural features of the compound. The most downfield signal at ~13 ppm is a sharp singlet, consistent with the carboxylic acid (COOH) proton, which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. A singlet at ~8 ppm corresponds to the aromatic proton on the pyridine ring adjacent to the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group. The electron-withdrawing CF3 group deshields this proton, shifting it downfield. Another aromatic proton, positioned meta to the OCH2-cyclopropyl substituent on the pyridine ring, appears as a singlet near ~6 ppm, slightly upfield due to reduced deshielding compared to the CF3-adjacent proton. The amide proton (NH) is observed as a broad signal near ~7 ppm, typical for amide N-H protons, which often exhibit variable chemical shifts and broadening due to hydrogen bonding. The OCH2 group of the cyclopropylmethoxy substituent appears as a triplet at ~4 ppm, reflecting coupling with the adjacent cyclopropyl CH2 protons. The cyclopropyl ring protons themselves resonate as multiplets in the ~0.5–1 ppm region, characteristic of the strained ring system. The aliphatic region (1–2.5 ppm) contains overlapping signals from the ethyl groups attached to the quaternary carbon. The CH2 groups adjacent to the quaternary center appear as a quartet near ~2 ppm, while the terminal CH3 groups resonate as a triplet at ~1 ppm. These splitting patterns arise from vicinal coupling between the CH2 and CH3 protons. The overall integration and multiplicity of peaks align with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of the pyridine core, CF3 group, cyclopropylmethoxy substituent, amide linkage, and carboxylic acid functionality. The spectrum provides clear evidence of the compound’s structural motifs through distinct chemical shifts and coupling patterns."

The spectrum exhibits a molecular ion peak at m/z 481, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 480.47 g/mol. The base peak at m/z 227 dominates the spectrum, indicating a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group and the amide bond. This fragment may represent a piperidine-pyridine-ether substructure, stabilized by resonance or charge localization. Key fragments include m/z 381, which corresponds to the loss of the Boc group (100 Da, C5H8O3), and m/z 365, possibly reflecting further loss of methanol (32 Da) or a methyl radical (15 Da) from the Boc-free intermediate. The peak at m/z 298 suggests elimination of the indole-ethyl moiety (C10H12N2, 160 Da) from the molecular ion. Additional fragments at m/z 280 and 282 may arise from homolytic cleavage of the pyridine-ether bond, with isotopic contributions from nitrogen or oxygen. The presence of m/z 309 and 310 indicates partial retention of the Boc group in smaller fragments, while m/z 425 could result from loss of the isopropyl amide side chain (57 Da, C4H7NO). The spectrum also shows minor peaks at m/z 133 and 187, likely representing indole-derived fragments (e.g., C8H9N2+ or C10H11N2+), consistent with the molecule’s core structure. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the molecule’s structural features, including the Boc-protected piperidine, indole-ethyl-pyridine scaffold, and isopropyl amide. The dominance of the m/z 227 fragment underscores the stability of the nitrogen-rich heterocyclic subunit under ionization conditions."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption bands corresponding to key functional groups in the molecule. A broad, moderate-intensity band near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of N–H stretching vibrations, likely from the secondary sulfonamide (–SO₂NH–) group. Sharp, strong peaks at ~1700 cm⁻¹ and ~1500 cm⁻¹ are consistent with carbonyl (C=O) stretching and aromatic C=C vibrations, respectively. The carbonyl peak aligns with the carbamate ester (–OCON–) moiety, while the aromatic region reflects the substituted benzene rings. Two prominent strong absorptions at ~1350 cm⁻¹ and ~1150 cm⁻¹ are indicative of asymmetric and symmetric S=O stretching vibrations from the two sulfone (–SO₂–) groups. The trifluoromethyl (–CF₃) group is evidenced by a sharp peak near 1100 cm⁻¹, corresponding to C–F stretching. Additional peaks in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) include C–N stretching (from the amine and carbamate) and C–O stretching (from the ester). The absence of broad O–H stretches above 3400 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of hydroxyl groups. This spectrum provides critical structural confirmation, as the observed bands directly correlate with the sulfonamide, carbamate, sulfone, and trifluoromethyl functionalities in the molecule.

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of hydrogen atoms in the molecule. The most downfield peak, observed at approximately 13 ppm, corresponds to the highly deshielded proton of the imidazole ring’s NH group in the purine-like bicyclic system. This proton experiences strong electron withdrawal from adjacent nitrogen atoms, resulting in its characteristic low-field position. Adjacent to this, a smaller peak near 12 ppm may arise from a minor tautomeric form or hydrogen-bonded NH species, though the structure contains only one NH proton. Aromatic protons from the pyridine ring appear in the 8–9 ppm region, with a distinct multiplet near 8 ppm. These protons are deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the ring nitrogen and substituents, including the methoxy (-OCH3) and fused purine-like groups. The splitting pattern suggests coupling between adjacent aromatic protons. The most intense signal, a complex multiplet centered at ~6 ppm, corresponds to the eight protons of the morpholine ring (N-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-N). These protons are split into multiple peaks due to their non-equivalent environments and coupling with neighboring protons. The downfield shift of this signal relative to typical aliphatic regions (3–4 ppm) reflects the electron-withdrawing influence of the oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the morpholine ring. A singlet near 3.8 ppm, though not prominently visible in the provided image, would typically represent the three protons of the methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to the pyridine ring. Its absence here may indicate suppression in the displayed region or overlap with other features. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the aromatic pyridine and imidazole rings, the morpholine substituent, and the methoxy group. The chemical shifts and splitting patterns provide insights into the electronic and steric interactions within this heterocyclic system."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. Key observations include: 1. **Aliphatic region (0–50 ppm):** - A prominent peak near 14 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (CH₃) of the ethyl ester moiety (CCOC=O). - Peaks around 25–30 ppm are attributed to the tert-butyl group (C(CH₃)₃), with the quaternary carbon appearing slightly upfield (~30 ppm) and the three equivalent methyl carbons (~25 ppm). - A signal near 40 ppm likely arises from the methylene (CH₂) group adjacent to the nitrogen in the tetrahydroquinoline ring system. 2. **Oxygenated/aliphatic region (50–100 ppm):** - A peak ~60 ppm corresponds to the methylene carbon (CH₂) of the ethyl ester (OCH₂CH₃). - The quaternary carbon of the tert-butyl group (C(CH₃)₃) appears near 55–60 ppm, consistent with its attachment to an electronegative nitrogen. 3. **Aromatic region (100–160 ppm):** - Multiple peaks between 110–140 ppm reflect the aromatic carbons of the two benzene rings. The substitution pattern (para- and meta-substituted rings) creates distinct environments, with carbons adjacent to the ester (C=O) or amide (NC=O) groups appearing downfield (~130–140 ppm). - A peak ~150 ppm may correspond to the carbon directly bonded to the nitrogen in the tetrahydroquinoline ring. 4. **Carbonyl region (160–180 ppm):** - A sharp, intense peak ~170 ppm is characteristic of the ester carbonyl carbon (C=O). - A weaker signal ~175 ppm could arise from the amide carbonyl (NC=O), though overlap with the ester peak is possible. The spectrum confirms the presence of all expected carbon types: aliphatic (ethyl, tert-butyl, methylene), aromatic, and carbonyl. The tert-butyl group’s symmetry reduces the number of observed peaks, while the aromatic rings exhibit multiple signals due to asymmetric substitution. The absence of peaks above 180 ppm indicates no additional carbonyl or highly deshielded carbons. This analysis aligns with the proposed structure, validating the molecular framework and functional groups."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption features consistent with the structural components of the compound. A prominent broad peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the N-H stretching vibration of the primary amine group, with its moderate intensity and slightly asymmetric shape indicating hydrogen bonding interactions. Adjacent to this, sharp peaks in the 2850–3000 cm⁻¹ region arise from C-H stretching vibrations in the aliphatic cyclopropane ring and aromatic phenyl group. The aromatic C-H stretches, typically observed between 3000–3100 cm⁻¹, overlap with the aliphatic signals, creating a clustered pattern. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), multiple distinct bands are observed. A strong absorption near 1600 cm⁻¹ and a weaker peak near 1500 cm⁻¹ correspond to C=C stretching vibrations in the aromatic ring, confirming its conjugated π-system. The presence of a chlorine substituent on the aromatic ring is supported by a sharp, medium-intensity band near 830 cm⁻¹, attributed to C-Cl stretching. Additional peaks between 1000–1300 cm⁻¹ likely originate from C-N stretching and ring deformation modes of the cyclopropane moiety. The absence of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch near 1700 cm⁻¹ aligns with the molecular formula, which lacks oxygen. The overall spectral profile—combining amine, aromatic, cyclopropane, and chloro-substituent features—correlates well with the proposed structure of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-(aminomethyl)cyclopropane. The high-resolution peaks and minimal baseline noise suggest a well-resolved spectrum, enabling precise identification of functional groups."

The most downfield ¹H chemical shift (~12 ppm) correlates with a ¹³C resonance near 150 ppm, indicative of a proton on an aromatic carbon adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, likely the hydroxyl-substituted carbon on the benzene ring. This shift reflects strong deshielding from the electronegative oxygen atom. A second cross-peak at ~10 ppm (¹H) and ~130 ppm (¹³C) suggests a proton on an aromatic carbon near the fluorine substituent, where fluorine's inductive effect deshields the adjacent hydrogen. The third cross-peak at ~2 ppm (¹H) and ~20 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methyl groups in the molecule, with the ¹³C shift consistent with sp³-hybridized carbons attached to aromatic systems. The benzene ring methyl (Cc1cc...) and the two pyrimidine ring methyls (c(C)ncnc1C) likely overlap in this region due to similar electronic environments.

Key features include clusters of cross-peaks in distinct regions that correspond to the molecule’s structural motifs. In the aliphatic region (¹H: 0–3 ppm; ¹³C: 10–60 ppm), several correlations are observed, likely arising from the isopropyl group (CH(CH₃)₂) attached to the indole nitrogen and the thiazolidine ring’s CH₂ groups. The methyl groups of the isopropyl substituent typically appear as upfield singlets in ¹H NMR (~1–2 ppm) with corresponding ¹³C shifts near 20–30 ppm. The thiazolidine ring’s methylene (CH₂) carbons adjacent to sulfur and nitrogen may exhibit downfield shifts (¹³C: 40–60 ppm) due to electronegative atom effects. Aromatic correlations dominate the ¹H range of 6–8 ppm and ¹³C range of 100–140 ppm, consistent with the indole ring system.

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak, observed near 200 ppm, corresponds to the carbonyl carbon of the amide group (C=O), which is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Moving upfield, a cluster of peaks between 150–170 ppm arises from aromatic carbons directly bonded to electronegative substituents, such as the phenolic oxygen (C–O in the hydroxyl-substituted benzene ring) and the methoxy group (O–CH3 in the anisole ring). These shifts are consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons in electron-deficient environments. The region from 100–140 ppm contains multiple peaks representing aromatic carbons in the three benzene rings (hydroxyl-substituted, methoxy-substituted, and tosyl groups). The splitting into distinct signals reflects the non-equivalent chemical environments caused by substituent effects and ring asymmetry. For instance, the hydroxyl-substituted ring exhibits peaks near 150 ppm (C–OH) and 110–130 ppm (remaining aromatic carbons), while the methoxy-substituted ring shows a peak near 160 ppm (C–OCH3) and others in the 110–130 ppm range. A prominent peak near 50 ppm is attributed to the methoxy group (O–CH3), which appears upfield due to the shielding effect of the oxygen atom. Additional peaks in the 40–60 ppm range correspond to aliphatic carbons, including the CH2 groups in the ethyl chain (CCN) and the benzylic CH2 attached to the hydroxyl-substituted aromatic ring. The most upfield signals, observed near 0–20 ppm, originate from methyl groups: the tosyl methyl (C–CH3) on the sulfonyl-substituted benzene ring (~20 ppm) and the terminal methyl of the ethyl group (CCN, ~10–15 ppm). These carbons are highly shielded due to their saturated, electron-rich environments. The spectrum’s peak intensities align with the number of equivalent carbons in each environment, though some overlap occurs due to the molecule’s complexity. Notably, the absence of peaks above 200 ppm confirms the lack of ketone or aldehyde carbonyls, consistent with the amide-only carbonyl in the structure.

The most intense peak at 4 ppm (integral ~3H) is attributed to the methyl group (–CH3) attached to the aromatic ring.

The aromatic ring system is further evidenced by multiple sharp peaks between 1600–1450 cm⁻¹, corresponding to C=C stretching modes. This IR spectrum provides clear evidence for the ester, amide, and chlorinated alkyl moieties in the molecule."

The spectrum displays characteristic absorption features corresponding to the functional groups present in this compound. A prominent peak near 1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the ester group, which is consistent with the strong dipole moment change during this vibration. Adjacent to this, the C-O single bond stretching of the ester and aromatic ether appears as a moderate band around 1250 cm⁻¹. The asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching vibrations of the alkyl chains (e.g., the isobutyl and ethoxy groups) manifest as sharp peaks between 2850–3000 cm⁻¹, with the most intense peak near 2960 cm⁻¹. The aromatic ring in the molecule contributes to multiple absorptions in the 1450–1600 cm⁻¹ region, corresponding to C=C stretching modes of the substituted benzene ring. The presence of halogen substituents (Cl, I, and CF₃) is reflected in lower-frequency vibrations: the C-F stretching of the trifluoromethoxy group (OCC(F)₃) appears as a strong, broad band near 1150 cm⁻¹, while C-Cl and C-I stretches are likely observed as weaker peaks below 800 cm⁻¹. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) exhibits a complex pattern of peaks due to combined bending and stretching vibrations of the molecule’s diverse functional groups, including potential contributions from C-H bending in the alkyl and aromatic moieties. Notably, the absence of a broad O-H stretching band around 3200–3600 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of hydroxyl groups in the structure, aligning with the provided SMILES notation. The spectrum’s overall profile—particularly the ester carbonyl peak, C-F absorption, and aromatic C=C bands—corroborates the molecular formula and structural features of this halogenated, fluorinated aromatic ester."

The spectrum displays five distinct peaks corresponding to the unique carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak at ~200 ppm is characteristic of the carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the ketone functional group. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~150 ppm arises from the sp²-hybridized carbon in the C=C double bond, which is deshielded due to its proximity to the electronegative oxygen in the methoxy group (OCH₃) attached to the double bond. A sharp peak at ~100 ppm corresponds to the quaternary carbon bearing two methoxy groups and a methyl group, as this carbon is directly bonded to oxygen atoms, causing significant deshielding. The two peaks at ~50 ppm and ~20 ppm represent the methoxy carbons (OCH₃) and the methyl group (CH₃), respectively. The methoxy carbons appear upfield due to their sp³ hybridization and shielding by electron-donating oxygen, while the methyl group shows further upfield resonance, typical for alkyl carbons in a relatively non-electronegative environment. The absence of additional peaks confirms the symmetry of the two methoxy groups on the central carbon, which are chemically equivalent. This spectrum aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the ketone, vinyl ether, and geminal dimethoxy substituents."

This base peak (100% relative abundance) confirms the molecular formula and indicates high stability of the protonated molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Several significant fragment ions are observed, providing insights into the structural features of the molecule. A peak at m/z 230 (30% abundance) suggests the loss of a neutral fragment with a mass of 27 Da, likely corresponding to the elimination of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) from the cyano group (-C#N) attached to the aromatic ring. The peak at m/z 212 (15% abundance) may arise from the cleavage of the dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2, 58 Da) combined with hydrogen rearrangement. A fragment at m/z 175 (45% abundance) aligns with the retention of the pyridine core (C5H4N) and the cyclohexyl substituent (C6H11), indicating a stable aromatic system. Additional peaks at m/z 163 (20% abundance) and m/z 131 (10% abundance) likely result from further fragmentation of the cyclohexyl ring or the pyridine moiety. The peak at m/z 117 (12% abundance) may correspond to a smaller aromatic fragment, such as a pyridine derivative with a nitrogen-containing substituent. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 100 suggests minimal fragmentation of the core aromatic structure.

The peak at m/z 256 suggests the loss of a neutral fragment of 45 Da, likely attributed to the elimination of a formyl group (CHO) from the formamide substituent (–CH2NHCHO) on the pyridine ring. The intense peak at m/z 243 corresponds to the loss of 58 Da, consistent with cleavage of the entire formamide side chain (–CH2NHCHO), leaving a pyridine-ether intermediate. The fragment at m/z 188 (loss of 113 Da) may arise from the combined elimination of the trifluoromethyl group (CF3, 69 Da) and a carbonyl (CO, 28 Da) or related rearrangements, reflecting instability in the pyrazole ring system.

The most downfield peak at ~170 ppm is assigned to the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (O=C(O)), characteristic of its deshielded environment due to the electronegative oxygen and resonance effects. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~70 ppm corresponds to the hydroxyl-bearing carbon ([C@@H](O)), which is deshielded by the electronegative hydroxyl group. The three remaining peaks in the upfield region (~40, ~30, and ~25 ppm) arise from the aliphatic carbons in the cyclobutane ring (CC1CCC1) and the methylene group (CH2) linking the hydroxyl carbon to the ring. The cyclobutane carbons appear split into two distinct environments (~30 and ~25 ppm), likely due to ring strain and puckering, which creates diastereotopic carbons. The peak at ~40 ppm is attributed to the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the cyclobutane, which experiences moderate deshielding from the ring’s electron-withdrawing effects. The absence of additional peaks confirms the molecule’s symmetry, with the cyclobutane’s four carbons resolved into two pairs of equivalent environments.

A prominent singlet at ~2.0 ppm corresponds to the nine equivalent protons of the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) attached to the ester oxygen. This upfield shift relative to typical alkyl protons (0.9–1.5 ppm) reflects deshielding by the adjacent electronegative oxygen atom. In the aromatic region (6.5–9.0 ppm), multiple peaks arise from the two conjugated aromatic systems: a benzene ring substituted with an amine (-NH2) and an ester-linked phenoxy group, and a naphthalene-like moiety with a nitrile (-C#N) substituent. The most intense aromatic peak at ~8.2 ppm likely corresponds to the proton ortho to the nitrile group on the naphthalene ring, as electron-withdrawing nitriles significantly deshield adjacent protons. Additional peaks between 7.2–7.8 ppm represent protons on the benzene ring and remaining naphthalene positions, with splitting patterns influenced by the asymmetric substitution and ring current effects. Notably, the amine protons (-NH2) on the benzene ring are absent in this spectrum, a common observation in H-NMR due to rapid exchange with trace water or solvent, leading to broadening beyond detection.

The adjacent peak at m/z 190 may represent a related fragmentation pathway involving hydrogen rearrangement. The ions at m/z 123 and 122 (difference of 1 Da) likely arise from cleavage of the sulfonamide (S-N) bond, with m/z 123 representing the sulfonated aromatic fragment (C₆H₄SO₂F, 123.08 Da) and m/z 122 indicating subsequent loss of a hydrogen atom.

Isotopic contributions are minimal, as expected for a molecule containing only one fluorine atom (¹⁹F) and no heavy isotopes with significant natural abundance (e.g., ³⁴S, 2.2% abundance). The absence of significant isotope peaks at m/z 207 or 208 supports this observation. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the structure of 4-methoxy-2-aminobenzenesulfonyl fluoride, with key diagnostic ions confirming the presence of the sulfonamide, methoxy, and amine functional groups.

A prominent sharp peak near 1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibrations of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) ester and the amide group, with the Boc carbonyl typically appearing at slightly higher wavenumbers (~1720–1740 cm⁻¹) and the amide carbonyl at lower wavenumbers (~1650–1680 cm⁻¹). The overlap of these bands suggests contributions from both groups. A series of weaker peaks in the 3300–3500 cm⁻¹ region may correspond to N–H stretching vibrations from the secondary amide and the imidazole ring in the histamine-derived moiety, though hydrogen bonding could broaden these features. Aromatic C–H stretching vibrations are evident near 3000–3100 cm⁻¹, consistent with the two benzyl groups and the imidazole ring. The region between 1500–1600 cm⁻¹ shows multiple peaks, likely due to C=C stretching in the aromatic rings and possibly C=N stretching in the imidazole. A strong absorption near 1200 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of C–O stretching in the Boc ester, while peaks in the 1000–1300 cm⁻¹ range may arise from C–N stretching in the amide and tertiary amine linkages. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains numerous sharp peaks, reflecting complex vibrational modes of the aromatic rings, aliphatic chains, and heterocyclic components. Notably, a distinct peak near 800–900 cm⁻¹ suggests out-of-plane C–H bending in monosubstituted or 1,2,4-disubstituted aromatic rings, supporting the presence of the phenyl and imidazole groups.

The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 364, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. The base peak (100% relative abundance) occurs at m/z 251, indicating a highly stable fragment ion resulting from significant fragmentation pathways. Additional notable peaks include m/z 262 (30% abundance), m/z 91 (45% abundance), and m/z 117, 133, 142, 158, 160, 172, 173, 199, and 290 (all <20% abundance). The peak at m/z 91 is characteristic of a benzyl cation (C7H7+), suggesting cleavage of the O-benzyl group from the indole moiety. Peaks at m/z 117 and 133 may arise from fragmentation of the indole ring system, with m/z 133 corresponding to a substituted indole fragment. The cluster of peaks between m/z 158–173 likely represents fragments involving the oxazole ring (CNC1=NC(=O)CO1) and adjacent substituents, with m/z 158 and 160 potentially indicating isotopic contributions or structural isomers. The peak at m/z 199 could correspond to a fragment retaining the indole and part of the oxazole ring. The high abundance of m/z 251 suggests a stable tautomer or charge-retaining structure, possibly involving the oxazole ring and adjacent alkyl chain. The m/z 262 peak may represent a fragment with a retained oxygen atom, potentially from rearrangement or elimination processes. The molecular ion peak (m/z 364) confirms the molecular weight, while the absence of higher-mass peaks indicates no dimerization or adduct formation. This fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the oxazole ring, indole system, and benzyl ether linkage. The spectrum provides evidence for both inductive cleavage and rearrangement pathways, typical of heterocyclic and aromatic-containing compounds under electron ionization."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides a two-dimensional correlation between directly bonded $^1$H and $^{13}$C nuclei, revealing key structural features of the molecule. The $^1$H chemical shifts are plotted on the x-axis (0–14 ppm), while the $^{13}$C chemical shifts are plotted on the y-axis (0–200 ppm). Each cross-peak corresponds to a proton-carbon pair within the molecule. The spectrum displays several distinct cross-peaks. A prominent peak at ~10 ppm ($^1$H) and ~200 ppm ($^{13}$C) is characteristic of the aldehyde group (-CHO) in the pyrimidine ring, as the formyl proton and carbon exhibit strong deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. Additional cross-peaks in the aromatic region (6–8.5 ppm for $^1$H and 110–140 ppm for $^{13}$C) correspond to protons and carbons in the benzothiazole and pyrimidine rings, as well as the trifluoromethylphenyl substituent. These shifts reflect the electron-deficient nature of the heterocycles and the electron-withdrawing effect of the CF$_3$ group, which deshields adjacent protons and carbons. A cross-peak at ~2 ppm ($^1$H) and ~25 ppm ($^{13}$C) is consistent with the methyl group (-CH$_3$) of the acetyl substituent, which appears upfield due to its aliphatic nature. Another notable peak at ~4 ppm ($^1$H) and ~55 ppm ($^{13}$C) may arise from a proton on a carbon adjacent to the ether oxygen (O-CH) in the pyrimidine-benzothiazole linkage, though such a shift suggests moderate deshielding from the electronegative oxygen. The absence of peaks in the 0–50 ppm range for $^{13}$C (excluding the methyl and O-CH regions) indicates few aliphatic or sp$^3$-hybridized carbons beyond the acetyl group. Quaternary carbons (e.g., the CF$_3$-substituted aromatic carbons or the carbonyl carbon of the acetyl group) do not produce HSQC signals, as they lack directly bonded protons. Overall, the HSQC spectrum aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including aromatic heterocycles, an aldehyde, an acetyl group, and an ether linkage, while confirming the connectivity of protonated carbons. The data provide critical insights into the electronic environment of the molecule’s functional groups and their spatial relationships."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing insights into the molecular framework. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm ¹H, 100–160 ppm ¹³C):** Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to the aromatic protons and carbons of the indole (c2c[nH]c3ccccc23), pyridine (c2cnc(OC)cn2), and aniline (c1cccc(N...)c1) rings. The indole’s C2-H and C3-H protons appear at ~7.2–7.5 ppm (¹H) with associated carbons at ~110–120 ppm (¹³C), while the pyridine’s C4-H and C6-H resonances are observed at ~8.0–8.5 ppm (¹H) and ~140–150 ppm (¹³C). The aniline ring’s meta-substituted pattern is reflected in the 6.8–7.0 ppm (¹H) and 115–130 ppm (¹³C) ranges. 2. **Methoxy Groups (3–4 ppm ¹H, 50–60 ppm ¹³C):** Two distinct cross-peaks at ~3.8 ppm (¹H) and ~55 ppm (¹³C) correspond to the OCH₃ groups on the aniline and pyridine rings. These signals confirm the presence of electron-donating substituents, which deshield adjacent protons and shift their ¹³C resonances upfield. 3. **Aliphatic Region (4–6 ppm ¹H, 60–80 ppm ¹³C):** A prominent cross-peak at ~5.2 ppm (¹H) and ~72 ppm (¹³C) arises from the central CH group in the NC(C=O) fragment. This proton is deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl and nitrogen, while its carbon exhibits a characteristic shift for a secondary alcohol-like environment. 4. **Indole NH (8–10 ppm ¹H, 100–120 ppm ¹³C):** A weak cross-peak near ~8.5 ppm (¹H) and ~110 ppm (¹³C) likely corresponds to the indole NH proton and its directly bonded carbon (C2 of the indole). The NH proton’s exchange broadening may reduce signal intensity. 5. **Carbonyl Region (Not Observed):** The ketone (C=O) at ~190 ppm (¹³C) is absent in the HSQC spectrum, as expected, since it lacks directly bonded protons. The spectrum confirms the connectivity of aromatic and aliphatic protons to their respective carbons, validating the proposed structure. The distribution of cross-peaks aligns with the molecule’s symmetry and functional groups, including the indole, pyridine, aniline, and methoxy substituents."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing critical insights into the molecular structure. The aromatic region (δH 6-8 ppm, δC 100-150 ppm) exhibits multiple well-resolved peaks, consistent with the naphthalene (δH ~7.5-8.5 ppm) and indole (δH ~7.0-7.5 ppm) moieties in the SMILES structure. These peaks demonstrate characteristic ¹H-¹³C correlations for sp²-hybridized carbons in conjugated systems. A distinct cluster of cross-peaks appears at δH ~10-12 ppm (δC ~120-140 ppm), likely corresponding to the indole C2-H and C3-H protons adjacent to the ketone substituent. In the aliphatic region, a prominent cross-peak at δH ~2.5 ppm (δC ~30 ppm) correlates with methylene (CH₂) groups in the hexanoic acid chain, while weaker signals at δH ~1.5 ppm (δC ~25 ppm) suggest terminal methyl (CH₃) environments. The downfield ¹³C shifts (δC ~170-180 ppm) with no corresponding ¹H correlations confirm the presence of two carbonyl carbons: one from the ketone (δC ~185 ppm) and one from the carboxylic acid (δC ~175 ppm), as indicated by the SMILES notation. The spectrum’s dispersion and peak patterns align with the molecule’s structural complexity, including the naphthalene ring (δC ~125-135 ppm), indole core (δC ~100-120 ppm), and flexible alkyl chain. Notably, the absence of cross-peaks in the δH < 2 ppm region suggests minimal conformational flexibility in the alkyl chain’s terminal methyl group. This HSQC data, combined with the molecular formula, strongly supports the assigned structure, highlighting the utility of 2D NMR in resolving complex aromatic and aliphatic subsystems."

The spectrum displays several distinct proton environments consistent with the molecular structure. The most prominent peak at ~2.5 ppm (high intensity) corresponds to the methylene (CH2) protons adjacent to the nitrogen atom in the piperidine ring, which are deshielded due to the electronegative nitrogen. A sharp peak at ~3.5 ppm is attributed to the CH2 group directly bonded to the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) group, as the oxygen atom further deshields these protons. The vinylic protons of the tetrahydropyridine ring (C=C) appear as a doublet or multiplet near ~6.5 ppm, reflecting their coupling with neighboring protons. The aromatic protons on the pyridine ring exhibit two distinct peaks: one at ~7.0 ppm (likely the proton ortho to the CF3 group) and another at ~8.0 ppm (ortho to the amino group), with the trifluoromethyl group causing significant deshielding of adjacent protons. A broad peak near ~10 ppm may arise from the amino group (NH2) on the pyridine ring, though its exact position can vary due to hydrogen bonding or solvent effects. The tert-butyl group of the Boc moiety produces a singlet at ~1.4 ppm, though its intensity is relatively low compared to the dominant CH2 signals. No signals are observed in the aldehyde or carboxylic acid regions, confirming the absence of such functional groups. The spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, with clear evidence of the Boc-protected amine, tetrahydropyridine unsaturation, and trifluoromethyl-substituted pyridine ring."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts, revealing direct heteronuclear couplings. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (¹H: 6–8.5 ppm; ¹³C: 100–150 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to protons and carbons in the aromatic systems, including the indole ring (c3cccc4c3ccn4) and substituted phenyl rings. The indole’s C2-H and C3-H protons appear as distinct peaks near 7.0–7.5 ppm (¹H) and ~120–130 ppm (¹³C), while the phenyl rings attached to the oxadiazole (c2nc(-c3...)no2) and trifluoromethyl-substituted benzene exhibit shifts slightly downfield due to electron-withdrawing effects of adjacent substituents. 2. **Aliphatic Region (¹H: 4–5 ppm; ¹³C: 60–80 ppm):** A prominent cross-peak near 4.8 ppm (¹H) and 75 ppm (¹³C) is assigned to the chiral methine proton (C[C@H]) adjacent to the ether oxygen (Oc1ccc...). The deshielded chemical shift of this proton reflects the electronegative oxygen atom. 3. **Carboxylic Acid (¹H: ~12 ppm; ¹³C: ~170 ppm):** A downfield cross-peak near 12 ppm (¹H) and 170 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH) and its directly bonded carbon. The extreme downfield shift arises from strong deshielding by the carbonyl group and hydrogen bonding. 4. **Trifluoromethyl Effects:** The presence of two CF3 groups (-C(F)(F)F) induces significant downfield shifts in nearby protons and carbons. For example, the aromatic protons ortho to the CF3 substituents on the benzene ring appear at ~8.0–8.5 ppm (¹H), while their attached carbons resonate near 130–140 ppm (¹³C). 5. **Oxadiazole Ring (¹H: ~8.5 ppm; ¹³C: ~160 ppm):** The oxadiazole ring (-no2) contributes a cross-peak near 8.5 ppm (¹H) and 160 ppm (¹³C), consistent with the deshielded proton adjacent to electronegative nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The HSQC spectrum confirms the connectivity of protons to their directly bonded carbons, validating the proposed structure. The absence of peaks in regions typical for quaternary carbons (e.g., 100–120 ppm in ¹³C with no corresponding ¹H) aligns with the presence of CF3 groups and non-protonated aromatic carbons. This analysis highlights the utility of HSQC in resolving complex molecular frameworks, particularly in fluorinated and heteroatom-rich compounds."

The most prominent peak at approximately 2.0 ppm corresponds to the nine equivalent methyl protons of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group, appearing as a singlet due to their symmetric environment. Adjacent to this, a sharp singlet at ~3.7 ppm integrates to three protons, characteristic of the methoxy (-OCH3) group attached to the carbonyl of the methyl ester. A broad singlet near 6.0 ppm is indicative of the NH proton of the Boc-protected amine, which is deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl group. The cyclohexane ring protons dominate the region between 1.0–2.0 ppm, exhibiting complex multiplets due to conformational rigidity and coupling interactions. These peaks reflect the non-equivalent environments of the ring hydrogens, influenced by the substituents at the 1-position. Notably, the absence of signals in the aromatic region (6.5–8.0 ppm) confirms the lack of unsaturated systems, aligning with the aliphatic structure.

The spectrum displays characteristic absorption bands corresponding to functional groups in this structure. A broad, moderate-intensity band near 3300 cm⁻¹ is consistent with N-H stretching from the pyrrole moiety, while the sharp, intense peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ aligns with C=O stretching from the ester group. Aromatic C=C stretching vibrations are evident in the 1450–1600 cm⁻¹ region, with multiple peaks reflecting the conjugated π-system across the indole and pyridine rings.

A singlet peak at approximately 12.5 ppm corresponds to the deshielded proton on the triazole ring, likely influenced by the electron-withdrawing chlorine substituent and the fused aromatic system, which significantly reduces electron density around this proton. A doublet at ~6.5 ppm (J ≈ 8.5 Hz) arises from the two equivalent aromatic protons on the benzene ring adjacent to the ester group. The splitting pattern suggests coupling with a neighboring proton, consistent with the meta-substitution pattern of the benzene ring in the fused bicyclic system. The absence of signals in the aliphatic region (0–4 ppm) confirms the lack of alkyl or methyl protons in the structure, though the methoxy groups (OCH3) in the SMILES notation typically resonate near 3.5–4.0 ppm.

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 50–140 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at ~50 ppm corresponds to the methylene carbon (O-CH2-) adjacent to the oxygen atom, which is shielded due to its sp³ hybridization and proximity to the electronegative oxygen. Two high-intensity peaks at ~60 ppm and ~70 ppm are attributed to the alkyne carbons: the ~60 ppm peak represents the carbon directly bonded to the oxygen (C#C-O), while the ~70 ppm peak corresponds to the terminal alkyne carbon (C#C-H), which is more deshielded due to its sp hybridization. In the aromatic region (100–140 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the naphthalene ring system. The peaks at ~120 ppm and ~130 ppm arise from the sp²-hybridized aromatic carbons. The substitution pattern of the naphthalene ring (with the OCH2 group at position 1) creates distinct electronic environments for the ring carbons, leading to several resolved peaks in this region. The absence of peaks above 150 ppm confirms the lack of carbonyl or highly conjugated carbons in the structure. The spectrum’s peak multiplicities and chemical shifts align with the expected structure: the alkyne and ether functionalities dominate the mid-range shifts, while the naphthalene ring’s aromatic carbons produce characteristic downfield resonances. The integration of peak intensities further supports the presence of one methylene, two alkyne, and ten aromatic carbons, consistent with the molecular formula C14H12O. This analysis underscores the utility of C-NMR in resolving carbon environments in complex aromatic-alkyne systems."

The base peak at m/z 138 indicates a highly stable fragment, likely formed via a significant cleavage or rearrangement. This fragment may result from the loss of 44 Da (CO₂ or a related neutral species) from the molecular ion, suggesting a structural rearrangement involving the aldehyde or ether functionalities. Prominent peaks at m/z 79 and 80 correspond to pyridine-based fragments, consistent with the aromatic heterocyclic core of the molecule.

Fragmentation patterns reveal key structural features: 1. Peaks at m/z 181 and 191 correspond to the naphthol moiety (C₁₀H₇O) and its derivatives, suggesting cleavage of the central carbon chain. 2. The m/z 206 peak likely arises from a fragment retaining the amide group and part of the aromatic system. 3. Peaks at 221, 233, and 248 indicate stepwise loss of acetyl (CH₃CO, 43 Da) and hydroxyl (OH, 17 Da) groups from the core structure. 4. Secondary fragments at m/z 273 and 285 may represent rearranged ions involving the biphenyl system (C₁₆H₁₃O₃). 5. The m/z 303 and 345 peaks suggest partial retention of the ester-linked side chains. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s multiple functional groups (amide, esters, aromatic rings), which undergo characteristic bond cleavages under electron ionization. The absence of peaks above m/z 404 confirms the molecular weight, while the distribution of fragments aligns with the proposed structure. This analysis demonstrates the utility of mass spectrometry in elucidating structural motifs through predictable fragmentation pathways."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing through-bond connectivity in the molecule. The plot displays cross-peaks at specific (¹H, ¹³C) chemical shift pairs, which correspond to covalently linked proton-carbon pairs. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic region (6–8.5 ppm ¹H, 100–150 ppm ¹³C):** A cluster of cross-peaks in this area reflects the presence of aromatic protons and their attached carbons. These likely originate from the pyrazine ring (c1cnc...cn1) and the benzene ring (c3ccccc3) in the SMILES structure. The pyrazine ring, with two nitrogen atoms, typically exhibits deshielded carbons (130–150 ppm) and protons (7.5–9 ppm), consistent with the observed peaks. The benzene ring’s protons and carbons appear at slightly lower shifts (6.5–7.5 ppm ¹H, 120–140 ppm ¹³C). 2. **Vinyl region (5.5–7 ppm ¹H, 110–130 ppm ¹³C):** A distinct cross-peak near 6.5 ppm (¹H) and 120 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the trans-configured alkene (/C=C/) in the ester side chain. The deshielding of these protons and carbons is typical for sp²-hybridized systems. 3. **Aliphatic region (1–4 ppm ¹H, 20–60 ppm ¹³C):** Peaks in this area arise from saturated carbons and their attached protons. The N-methyl groups (N(C)C) in the benzene substituent produce cross-peaks near 2.5 ppm (¹H) and 40 ppm (¹³C). The piperidine ring ([C@@H]2CCN...C2) contributes to peaks in the 1.5–3.5 ppm (¹H) and 25–55 ppm (¹³C) ranges, reflecting CH₂ groups adjacent to nitrogen. 4. **Carbonyl region (160–170 ppm ¹³C):** While the ester carbonyl (COC(=O)) is not directly observable in HSQC (as it lacks attached protons), its presence is inferred from the molecular formula and the vinyl cross-peak at ~6.5 ppm (¹H), which corresponds to the α-proton of the α,β-unsaturated ester. The spectrum’s dispersion of cross-peaks across distinct chemical shift ranges aligns with the structural complexity of the molecule, which includes aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic components. The HSQC data confirm the connectivity of protons to their respective carbons, supporting the assigned SMILES notation and molecular formula. This analysis highlights the utility of HSQC spectroscopy in elucidating molecular frameworks by mapping heteronuclear correlations."

The spectrum displays a dominant molecular ion peak at m/z 361, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound, which aligns with the calculated mass of 362.33 g/mol (C21H14O7). The base peak at m/z 361 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. A notable isotopic peak at m/z 364 (relative abundance ~20%) suggests the presence of one or more heavy isotopes, likely carbon-13, consistent with the 21-carbon framework. Several significant fragment ions are observed in the spectrum. Peaks at m/z 291, 275, and 245 represent major fragmentation pathways. The m/z 291 peak (relative abundance ~40%) may arise from the loss of a methoxy group (-OCH3, 31 Da) and a carbonyl group (-CO, 28 Da) from the molecular ion (361 - 31 - 28 = 302, though exact mass differences require precise calibration). The m/z 275 peak (relative abundance ~35%) could result from further fragmentation of the phthalide ring system, releasing CO2 (44 Da) from the m/z 319 ion (361 - 42 Da). The m/z 245 peak (relative abundance ~30%) may correspond to a retro-Diels-Alder cleavage of the benzodioxole moiety, a common fragmentation pattern for oxygen-containing aromatic systems. Additional peaks in the range m/z 250–333 reflect complex fragmentation of the polycyclic structure, including potential losses of methanol, CO, and CO2 from the methoxy and dioxole substituents. The peak at m/z 379 (relative abundance ~25%) may indicate a minor adduct formation or an ionized dimeric species, though this is not directly explained by the given molecular formula. The absence of peaks above m/z 400 confirms the molecular weight is consistent with the proposed formula. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern highlights the stability of the aromatic core and the susceptibility of oxygen-rich functional groups (e.g., methoxy, dioxole, and carbonyl) to undergo homolytic or heterolytic cleavage. These features are characteristic of polyphenolic or lignan-like structures, where electron-rich aromatic systems stabilize radical cations during ionization. The data supports the structural assignment of the compound as a methoxy-substituted dibenzodioxocine derivative, with fragmentation pathways dominated by the loss of small neutral molecules and cleavage of labile oxygen-containing moieties."

A prominent peak at m/z 108, accompanied by a minor isotopic peak at 109, suggests a fragment retaining the pyridine ring and hydrazine moiety after loss of iodine (I•), consistent with the calculated mass of C5H6N3+ (108). Additional fragments at m/z 204 and 219/221 may arise from the loss of hydrazine (N2H4, 32 Da) and ammonia (NH3, 17 Da) from the molecular ion, respectively. Lower-abundance peaks at m/z 76, 78, and 80 correspond to pyridine ring fragments (e.g., C5H4N+ and C5H6N+), reflecting partial ring degradation. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 236 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity, while the distribution of fragments aligns with expected dissociation pathways for a hydrazine-substituted iodopyridine.

The spectrum displays several prominent peaks that provide insights into the molecular structure and fragmentation behavior. The most intense peak at m/z 146 represents the base peak, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. A molecular ion peak is observed at m/z 221, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the molecular weight of 220 g/mol for C12H16N2O2. Key fragmentation peaks include m/z 94, 106, 115, 119, 120, 129, 163, 200, and 207. The peak at m/z 146 likely arises from cleavage of the carbamate group (COO) and loss of the methoxy (OCH3) moiety, leaving a fragment containing the cyclobutane ring and aromatic amine. The m/z 106 peak may correspond to a tropylium-like ion derived from the para-aminophenyl group, while m/z 115 and 119 suggest further fragmentation of the aromatic ring or adjacent substituents. The m/z 94 peak could represent a cyclobutane-amine fragment, stabilized by resonance or inductive effects. The m/z 163 peak may result from the loss of a methyl group (CH3, 15 Da) or a neutral fragment like CO2 (44 Da) from the molecular ion. Peaks at m/z 200 and 207 might indicate isotopic contributions or minor adducts, though their low abundance suggests they are less significant. The absence of a strong molecular ion peak at m/z 220 (neutral M) and the dominance of [M+H]+ at 221 imply the use of ionization techniques like electrospray ionization (ESI), which favor protonated species. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule: a carbamate-linked cyclobutane and para-aminophenyl group. The spectrum highlights the stability of aromatic and cyclic fragments, with the base peak at m/z 146 reflecting a major decomposition pathway involving carbamate cleavage. These observations confirm the molecular identity and provide diagnostic markers for structural validation."

A prominent singlet at ~4.0 ppm with high intensity corresponds to the methyl group (-NCH3) attached to the carbamate nitrogen, exhibiting downfield shifting due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carbonyl group. A broad singlet at ~12.0 ppm is attributed to the phenolic hydroxyl proton (-OH) on the benzene ring, indicative of hydrogen bonding or rapid exchange in the NMR timescale. The aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm) reveals multiple peaks, reflecting the complex substitution pattern of the naphthalene and benzene rings. The multiplet at ~7.2–7.8 ppm integrates to 10 protons, consistent with the aromatic hydrogens on the naphthalene core (positions 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) and the phenyl ring (positions 3', 4', 5', 6'). A distinct singlet at ~8.2 ppm corresponds to the imine proton (-N=C-H) formed by condensation of the amine and aldehyde groups, which is deshielded due to the electron-deficient nature of the imine carbon. The absence of peaks in the aliphatic region (0–3 ppm) confirms no sp³-hybridized carbons beyond the methyl group, while the lack of signals above 13 ppm excludes carboxylic acid or strongly acidic protons.

The sulfone group’s electron-withdrawing effect deshields adjacent aromatic protons, shifting them downfield. Notably, the hydroxyl proton (O–H) and carboxylic acid proton (COOH) are absent, likely due to rapid exchange or broadening. Quaternary carbons, such as those bonded to bromine or the sulfone group, lack direct 1H correlations and are not visible.

The spectrum displays characteristic absorption bands corresponding to functional groups in the molecule. A broad, moderate-intensity peak near 3350 cm⁻¹ suggests N–H stretching vibrations, likely from the primary amine (–NH₂) and secondary amine (–NH–) groups in the structure. Sharp peaks around 2950 cm⁻¹ and 2870 cm⁻¹ indicate C–H stretching in aliphatic regions, consistent with the ethyl (CCC) and methoxy (OCH₃) substituents. A prominent peak at ~1600 cm⁻¹ corresponds to C=N stretching in the pyridine ring, while a shoulder near 1500 cm⁻¹ may arise from aromatic C=C vibrations in the substituted benzene ring. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains multiple peaks, including a distinct band near 1250 cm⁻¹ attributable to C–O stretching in the methoxy groups. A sharp, intense peak at ~830 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of C–Cl stretching, confirming the presence of the chlorine substituent. Additionally, a weaker absorption near 1100 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C–F stretching from the fluorine atom. The overall spectral profile aligns with the molecular structure, highlighting key functional groups such as amines, ethers, halogens, and aromatic systems."

The spectrum displays characteristic absorption features corresponding to the functional groups present in this heterocyclic compound. In the region between 3500–3000 cm⁻¹, a series of weak to moderate peaks are observed, likely attributable to N–H stretching vibrations from the thiourea moiety (C=S(NH)N) and C–H stretching from aromatic and aliphatic carbons. The sharp peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests a secondary amine N–H stretch, while the broader features around 3100 cm⁻¹ may correspond to aromatic C–H overtones. Between 3000–2800 cm⁻¹, the spectrum shows distinct aliphatic C–H stretching bands, particularly from the piperidine ring (N1CCC(C2...)CC1) and methylthio group (CSC). The sharp peak near 2950 cm⁻¹ is consistent with symmetric C–H stretching in CH₂ or CH₃ groups. A weak absorption near 2200 cm⁻¹ may indicate the presence of the nitrile group (C#N), though its intensity is subdued, possibly due to conjugation or steric effects. The fingerprint region (1500–500 cm⁻¹) contains numerous diagnostic peaks. A prominent band near 1600 cm⁻¹ is likely due to C=N stretching in the pyridine ring (c3cccnc32) and/or aromatic C=C vibrations from the chlorophenyl group (c3ccc(Cl)cc3). Peaks around 1450–1350 cm⁻¹ may arise from C–N stretching in the piperidine and thiourea moieties, as well as C–S stretching from the thioether (SCc3cccnc32) and methylthio (CSC) groups. The strong absorption near 1200 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of C–S bonds, while the sharp peak at ~1000 cm⁻¹ could correspond to C–Cl stretching from the chlorinated aromatic ring. Additional bending vibrations, such as C–H out-of-plane modes in the aromatic rings and ring deformation modes, contribute to the complex pattern below 900 cm⁻¹. The overall spectral profile aligns with the structural complexity of the molecule, reflecting contributions from its heterocyclic, aromatic, and sulfur-containing functional groups. This IR spectrum provides critical insights into the vibrational dynamics of the compound, supporting its identification and structural validation."

The spectrum exhibits several diagnostic absorption bands consistent with the functional groups present in the structure. A broad, intense peak near 2500–3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the O–H stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group (C(=O)O), which is typically broadened due to hydrogen bonding. A sharp, strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the C=O stretching of the carboxylic acid carbonyl, while a slightly weaker peak near 1650 cm⁻¹ likely arises from the amide carbonyl (C(=O)N) stretch.

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H11IN2O (SMILES: Cn1cc(CO)nc1-c1ccc(I)cc1). The spectrum displays several distinct peaks that correspond to the protons in the molecule. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at approximately 10.5 ppm, which is highly deshielded. This peak likely corresponds to the proton at the C5 position of the imidazole ring, adjacent to two nitrogen atoms. The strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitrogens and the aromatic ring current deshield this proton, shifting its resonance downfield. Two doublets at ~7.5 ppm and ~7.0 ppm, each integrating to two protons, are observed in the aromatic region. These peaks are characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring, where the iodine atom at the para position relative to the imidazole attachment creates two distinct sets of equivalent protons. The doublet at 7.5 ppm arises from the protons ortho to the iodine (more deshielded due to its electron-withdrawing inductive effect), while the doublet at 7.0 ppm corresponds to the meta protons. The coupling pattern (J ~8 Hz) is consistent with the ortho/meta splitting in a para-disubstituted benzene. A smaller singlet at ~6.5 ppm is visible, which may correspond to the methylene protons (-CH2-) of the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) attached to the imidazole ring. The chemical shift is slightly downfield, likely due to the electronegative oxygen atom and the ring’s electron-deficient environment. A broad, low-intensity peak near ~5.5 ppm could be attributed to the hydroxyl proton (-OH), which often appears as a variable, exchange-broadened signal depending on hydrogen bonding and solvent effects. No distinct peak is observed for the N-methyl group (-NCH3) in the expected 3.0–3.5 ppm range, possibly due to overlap with baseline noise or low signal intensity. The absence of additional peaks in the aliphatic region (0–2 ppm) confirms the lack of other saturated protons in the structure. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, with key features reflecting the aromatic system, imidazole ring protons, and hydroxymethyl substituent. The iodine’s influence on aromatic proton deshielding and the imidazole ring’s electronic environment are critical in interpreting the observed chemical shifts."

The HSQC experiment correlates directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, producing cross-peaks that map proton chemical shifts (x-axis, 14 to -2 ppm) to their attached carbon chemical shifts (y-axis, 0 to 200 ppm). Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6.5–8.5 ppm ¹H, 120–150 ppm ¹³C):** Two prominent cross-peaks appear near (7.2 ppm ¹H, 128 ppm ¹³C) and (7.8 ppm ¹H, 135 ppm ¹³C). These correspond to aromatic protons on the benzene ring, which is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups (-CF₃ and -NO₂). The deshielded proton at 7.8 ppm likely arises from a position ortho to the nitro group, while the peak at 7.2 ppm may reflect protons meta or para to substituents. The associated carbons are also downfield-shifted due to the aromatic ring's electron-deficient environment. 2. **S-Methyl Group (2.5 ppm ¹H, ~50 ppm ¹³C):** A distinct cross-peak at (2.5 ppm ¹H, 50 ppm ¹³C) is observed, assignable to the methyl group attached to the sulfonyl sulfur (-S(=O)₂CH₃). The carbon resonance at 50 ppm reflects strong deshielding by the adjacent sulfonyl group, while the proton shift is consistent with a methyl group bonded to an electronegative atom. 3. **Trifluoromethyl-Adjacent Carbon (~7.5 ppm ¹H, ~125 ppm ¹³C):** A cross-peak near (7.5 ppm ¹H, 125 ppm ¹³C) likely corresponds to the aromatic proton ortho to the -CF₃ group. The carbon resonance at 125 ppm is slightly upfield of typical aromatic carbons due to the inductive effect of the trifluoromethyl group, which withdraws electron density through the ring. 4. **Nitro-Substituted Aromatic Carbon (~8.0 ppm ¹H, ~145 ppm ¹³C):** A peak at (8.0 ppm ¹H, 145 ppm ¹³C) suggests a proton ortho to the nitro group (-NO₂). The carbon’s downfield shift (145 ppm) reflects the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group, which deshields the aromatic carbon. The spectrum lacks peaks for quaternary carbons (e.g., the -CF₃ carbon or the carbon bearing the nitro group), as HSQC only detects carbons with directly attached protons. The observed correlations align with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of a substituted aromatic ring, an S-methyl sulfone group, and the spatial relationships of the substituents. This analysis demonstrates how HSQC spectroscopy resolves proton-carbon connectivity, aiding in the structural elucidation of complex molecules."

The spectrum displays distinct resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in this chiral molecule. The most downfield peak near 180 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon of the acetamide group (N–CO–CH3), a characteristic feature of amide functionalities. Adjacent to this, a sharp resonance at ~150 ppm arises from the aromatic carbon bonded to the methoxy group (C–OCH3), indicative of electron-donating oxygen substitution on the benzene ring. A cluster of peaks between 130–140 ppm represents aromatic carbons in the chlorinated phenyl ring, with the chlorine substituent causing deshielding effects and splitting patterns typical of meta/para-directing halogens. The broad signal near 120–130 ppm encompasses the remaining aromatic carbons in both phenyl rings, while the peak at ~60 ppm is assigned to the quaternary carbon (C1) bearing the nitrogen substituents in the central heterocyclic ring. The methoxy group (–OCH3) appears as a distinct singlet around 50 ppm, consistent with its high electron density. Aliphatic regions show resonances at ~25–30 ppm for the methyl groups attached to the acetamide nitrogen (N–CO–CH3) and the isopropyl moiety (C–CH–CH3), with the latter’s branching causing slight upfield shifts. Additional peaks near 10–20 ppm correspond to the remaining aliphatic carbons in the heterocyclic ring, influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of adjacent nitrogen atoms. The absence of peaks above 200 ppm confirms no aldehyde or ketone functionalities beyond the acetamide group. The overall distribution of resonances aligns with the proposed structure, demonstrating the molecule’s symmetry and substitution patterns.

These peaks are typical for sp²-hybridized C-H bonds in aromatic systems. A broad, less intense band near 2900 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C-H stretching in the CH₂ group adjacent to the bromine atom (BrC), though this region can overlap with overtone and combination bands. A prominent absorption near 1600 cm⁻¹ is consistent with C=C stretching vibrations in the aromatic rings, while a sharp peak around 1450 cm⁻¹ likely arises from C=N stretching in the thiazole heterocycle. The strong absorption at ~1050 cm⁻¹ is indicative of C-S stretching, a hallmark of thiazole-containing compounds. Additionally, a distinct peak near 700 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C-Br stretching, though this region often overlaps with out-of-plane C-H bending modes of the aromatic rings. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains multiple sharp peaks, reflecting complex vibrational coupling involving C-C, C-N, and C-S bonds. Notably, the absence of broad absorptions above 3200 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of O-H or N-H functional groups, aligning with the molecular formula. The spectrum’s features collectively support the presence of a brominated thiazole ring linked to a phenyl group, with no significant impurities or unexpected functional groups detected.

The spectrum exhibits several prominent peaks indicative of characteristic fragmentation patterns. The base peak at m/z 57 corresponds to the tert-butyl carbocation [(C(CH3)3)+], a hallmark of tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group fragmentation. This peak dominates due to the stability of the tertiary carbocation. Another significant peak at m/z 76 suggests a fragment containing the N-methyl carbamate moiety [CH2N(CH3)COO]+, formed via cleavage of the amide bond. The peak at m/z 98 likely arises from the [C6H12N2O]+ fragment, retaining the amide linkage and part of the Boc group. A cluster of peaks between m/z 127–133, particularly the intense signal at m/z 129, may represent a rearranged ion involving the Boc-protected amine and adjacent carbons, potentially stabilized by hydrogen migration. The peak at m/z 173, nearly as abundant as the base peak, corresponds to a large fragment retaining most of the molecular structure after loss of the allyl group (C3H5, 41 Da), consistent with the molecular ion [M – C3H5]+. Additional minor peaks at m/z 113, 155, and 173 further support sequential fragmentation pathways, including losses of CO2 (44 Da) and smaller hydrocarbon units. The absence of a detectable molecular ion peak (expected at m/z 228) aligns with the high lability of the Boc-protected amine under electron ionization, favoring extensive fragmentation. The observed pattern reflects the compound’s structural features: the Boc group’s propensity to generate stable tert-butyl cations, amide bond cleavage, and allyl group elimination. These data collectively confirm the molecular identity and provide insights into its gas-phase fragmentation behavior."

The most prominent peak appears near 10 ppm as a sharp singlet, which is characteristic of a deshielded proton, likely the hydroxyl group (-OH) at position 4 of the benzene ring. This downfield shift arises from hydrogen bonding and electron-withdrawing effects of adjacent oxygen atoms. In the aromatic region (6–8 ppm), multiple peaks of moderate intensity are observed, corresponding to the four aromatic protons on the benzene ring. These protons exhibit splitting patterns influenced by the hydroxyl group and the fused furan ring. The substitution pattern (hydroxyl at position 4) creates a non-uniform electronic environment, leading to complex multiplets. The furan ring, fused to the benzene ring, contributes to the deshielding of nearby protons, further splitting the aromatic signals. A smaller singlet near 2 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the furan ring at position 3. This upfield shift is typical for aliphatic protons, though the proximity to the electron-withdrawing ketone (C=O) at position 2 slightly deshields the methyl protons compared to a standard alkyl group. The absence of signals in the 3–5 ppm range suggests no protons are directly adjacent to highly electronegative atoms (e.g., no -OCH3 or -CH2- groups). The ketone at position 2 does not produce a direct NMR signal but influences the electronic environment of the furan ring and nearby protons.

A cluster of signals around 50–60 ppm corresponds to carbons directly bonded to nitrogen atoms, including the quaternary carbon of the cyclobutane ring (attached to both the amide side chain and the piperidine nitrogen) and the piperidine ring carbons adjacent to nitrogen. The cyclopropane carbons, strained and influenced by their attachment to both the phenyl ring and piperidine nitrogen, appear in the 20–30 ppm range. Additional peaks in the 20–40 ppm region are attributed to the methylene groups of the cyclobutane and piperidine rings, as well as the N-methyl groups of the dimethylamide moiety. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s stereochemical and structural diversity, with distinct chemical shifts for carbons in different electronic environments. The absence of overlapping peaks in critical regions suggests minimal symmetry in the molecule, consistent with the presence of chiral centers and multiple fused ring systems. This C-NMR spectrum provides a detailed fingerprint of the compound’s carbon framework, enabling correlation between observed chemical shifts and specific structural features."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 358, corresponding to the intact molecule, confirming the molecular weight of 357.8 g/mol. The base peak at m/z 153, the most abundant fragment, likely arises from cleavage of the bond between the benzophenone carbonyl and the adjacent aromatic ring, generating a stable benzoyl cation (C8H6ClO⁺) with a chlorine isotope peak at m/z 155. Additional significant peaks include m/z 154 (isotopic contribution from ³⁷Cl), m/z 114 (loss of Cl from the benzoyl fragment), and m/z 89, which may correspond to a pyrrolidine-derived fragment (C5H8NO⁺). Peaks at m/z 231 and 287 suggest fragmentation involving the loss of the pyrrolidine-acetic acid moiety (C6H10NO2, 128 Da) and further rearrangements. The presence of m/z 298 and 299 indicates potential neutral losses of small molecules (e.g., CO₂ or H₂O) from larger fragments. The spectrum also exhibits a series of smaller peaks (e.g., m/z 128, 149, 174, 197, 210) consistent with aromatic ring cleavage and aliphatic chain fragmentation. The chlorine isotope pattern (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ≈ 3:1) is evident in peaks containing the chlorine atom, such as m/z 153/155 and 114/116. These features align with the structural motifs of the molecule, including the chlorinated aromatic ring, benzophenone core, and pyrrolidine-acetic acid side chain. The spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule’s fragmentation pathways, dominated by cleavage at labile bonds and stabilization of charged fragments through resonance or inductive effects."

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to functional groups in the molecule. A sharp, intense peak near 1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the ketone group within the furanone ring. The aromatic C-H stretching vibrations appear as weaker peaks in the 3000–3100 cm⁻¹ region, consistent with the substituted benzene ring. The sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N) displays two prominent asymmetric and symmetric S=O stretching bands near 1350 cm⁻¹ and 1150 cm⁻¹, respectively, which are highly diagnostic of sulfone functionalities. Additionally, a distinct absorption near 600 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C-Cl stretching vibration of the chloro-substituted aromatic ring. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains multiple peaks arising from complex vibrational modes of the aromatic system, the furanone ring, and the pyrrolidine ring (N3CCCC3). Notably, the absence of broad O-H or N-H stretching bands aligns with the molecule’s lack of hydroxyl or primary/secondary amine groups, as the sulfonamide nitrogen is tertiary within the cyclic structure. These spectral features collectively confirm the presence of ketone, sulfone, chloroaryl, and heterocyclic moieties in the compound."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, reflecting the diverse proton environments in the molecule. A prominent singlet at ~10 ppm corresponds to the phenolic hydroxyl proton (OH) attached to the aromatic ring, indicative of hydrogen bonding or deshielded electronic effects. The aromatic region (6–8 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks, likely arising from the two benzene rings in the structure: one from the indole-like fused ring system (c2ccccc21) and the other from the substituted tetralin moiety (c2cc3c(cc2O)CCCC3). These peaks appear as overlapping multiplets due to spin-spin coupling and the asymmetry of the aromatic systems. A sharp singlet at ~4 ppm is attributed to the methylene group (OCH2) of the ethyl ester, deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom. The triplet at ~2 ppm and the quartet at ~1 ppm correspond to the ethyl ester’s CH2CH3 group, though the latter may overlap with aliphatic signals. The peak at ~3 ppm likely represents the methylene group (NCH2) adjacent to the amide carbonyl, which is deshielded by the electron-withdrawing effect of the lactam ring. Additional aliphatic peaks at ~1–2 ppm arise from the cyclohexane ring (CCCC3) in the tetralin substructure, where protons experience shielding from the saturated carbon framework. The absence of signals above 12 ppm confirms no carboxylic acid or strongly hydrogen-bonded protons beyond the phenolic OH. The spectrum’s simplicity in the aliphatic region suggests rapid rotation around single bonds or symmetry in the cyclohexane ring. Integration of peak areas would further clarify proton counts, but the observed shifts align with the structural features of the provided SMILES, including the ester, lactam, aromatic, and aliphatic components. This H-NMR spectrum effectively highlights the molecule’s functional groups and their electronic environments."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides correlations between directly bonded proton (1H) and carbon (13C) atoms, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the structure. The spectrum displays two primary clusters of cross-peaks. The first cluster appears in the aromatic region, with 1H chemical shifts between 10–12 ppm and 13C shifts between 120–130 ppm. These peaks correspond to the aromatic protons and their directly attached carbons from the two benzene rings in the molecule. The fluorine substituent on one aromatic ring induces deshielding effects, shifting adjacent protons and carbons downfield, which explains the elevated chemical shifts observed. The second cluster, located at 5–6 ppm (1H) and 50–70 ppm (13C), corresponds to the methylene (CH2) or methyl (CH3) groups. In this case, it is attributed to the methyl group attached to the sulfonamide nitrogen (N-CH3), as the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl (S=O) group deshields the methyl protons, shifting their resonance downfield compared to a typical methyl group. The absence of cross-peaks in the aldehyde region (expected ~9–10 ppm for 1H and ~190 ppm for 13C) suggests either poor sensitivity for this functional group under the experimental conditions or potential exchange broadening of the aldehyde proton. Overall, the spectrum confirms the presence of aromatic and methyl environments consistent with the proposed structure, while the fluorine and sulfonyl groups influence the chemical shifts of nearby nuclei through inductive and anisotropic effects."

The spectrum displays distinct resonances in the aromatic and carbonyl regions, consistent with the molecular structure. The most prominent peak appears near 165 ppm, corresponding to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the amide group, which is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Additional high-intensity signals are observed between 130–140 ppm, attributable to aromatic carbons in the chlorophenyl and fluorophenyl rings. The peak near 135 ppm likely arises from the carbon directly bonded to the chlorine atom, as halogens induce downfield shifts in adjacent carbons. A resonance near 125 ppm is consistent with a carbon atom ortho to the fluorine substituent on the phenyl ring, reflecting the strong electronegativity of fluorine. Peaks in the 110–120 ppm range correspond to other aromatic carbons in the heterocyclic thiazole ring (s2) and the remaining positions on the phenyl rings. The absence of signals below 100 ppm indicates no aliphatic or sp³-hybridized carbons are present, aligning with the fully aromatic and heterocyclic nature of the molecule.

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to functional groups in the molecule. A broad, moderate-intensity peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the N–H stretching vibration of the secondary aniline group (Nc4cccc(Cl)c4F), while weaker peaks in the 2900–3000 cm⁻¹ region arise from C–H stretching vibrations in aliphatic and aromatic moieties.

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of hydrogen atoms in the molecule. In the aliphatic region (0–3 ppm), a prominent triplet near 1.0 ppm and a doublet at ~1.2 ppm correspond to the methyl groups of the ethyl (CH3-CH2-) and isopropyl (CH(CH3)) moieties, respectively. These splitting patterns arise from spin-spin coupling with adjacent methylene (CH2) and methine (CH) protons.

A broad multiplet at ~3.8 ppm likely represents the methine proton (CH) adjacent to the amine (NH2) and carbonyl (C=O) groups, which deshields this proton due to electron-withdrawing effects. The aromatic region (6–10 ppm) exhibits multiple sharp peaks, characteristic of the pyridazine ring (N1C=CC=CC=N1). Peaks at ~6.0, 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5 ppm correspond to the four aromatic protons. The downfield shifts (higher ppm) of these signals reflect deshielding by the electronegative ring nitrogens. The splitting patterns (doublets and multiplets) suggest coupling between vicinal protons on the heterocycle. Notably, the absence of signals above 10 ppm indicates no strongly acidic protons (e.g., carboxylic acids) are present. The spectrum’s intensity distribution aligns with the molecule’s proton count: aliphatic peaks (lower intensity) and aromatic peaks (higher intensity) reflect the relative number of contributing hydrogens. No significant broad signals are observed in the 4–6 ppm range, suggesting the amine (NH2) protons may be exchange-broadened or overlap with other features. Overall, the spectrum’s features confirm the presence of aliphatic, heteroaromatic, and functional groups consistent with the provided molecular structure."

A prominent singlet at ~11.5 ppm is observed, likely attributed to the primary amine (NH2) group on the piperidine ring, which is deshielded due to hydrogen bonding or solvent interactions. In the aromatic region, three well-defined peaks at ~8.5 ppm, ~7.8 ppm, and ~7.5 ppm correspond to the pyridine ring protons. The proton adjacent to the oxygen atom in the pyridine ring (position 3) appears most downfield (~8.5 ppm), while the remaining protons (positions 4 and 6) are split by the bromine substituent, resulting in the observed chemical shifts. A singlet at ~4.5 ppm is consistent with the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the oxygen atom in the lactam ring (OCH2), deshielded by the electronegative oxygen and carbonyl group.

The spectrum displays a molecular ion peak at m/z 402, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 401 g/mol for C24H23N3O3. The base peak at m/z 144 indicates the most abundant fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the molecule into a stable cationic fragment. This fragment may represent the indole-derived moiety (C8H6N) combined with a carbonyl group (C=O), yielding a structure such as [C9H6NO]+ (calculated m/z 144.15), stabilized by resonance within the aromatic indole system. Prominent peaks at m/z 154 and 166 suggest further fragmentation of the indole or pyridine rings, possibly involving loss of small neutral species like CO (28 Da) or CH3 (15 Da). The cluster of peaks between m/z 249–259, particularly at 249, 250, and 259, likely corresponds to larger fragments retaining portions of the aromatic systems and functional groups. For instance, the peak at 259 (402 – 143) may result from cleavage adjacent to the central carbonyl group, retaining the indole-carbonyl-pyridine substructure. The peak at m/z 285 (402 – 117) could indicate loss of the indole moiety (C8H6N, 117 Da), leaving a fragment containing the methoxy-substituted benzene ring and pyridine. Lower-abundance peaks in the 100–170 m/z range, such as 107, 118, and 137, are consistent with smaller aromatic fragments or substituent losses (e.g., methoxy groups, methyl radicals). The peak at m/z 192 may represent a fragment retaining the pyridine ring (C6H6N, 92 Da) combined with a methoxy-substituted phenyl group (C8H8O2, 136 Da), though further structural elucidation would require tandem MS analysis. Overall, the spectrum reflects the molecule’s susceptibility to fragmentation at labile bonds, particularly those adjacent to the carbonyl and heteroaromatic rings. The dominance of the indole-derived fragment at m/z 144 underscores the stability of this substructure under ionization conditions, while the molecular ion peak at 402 confirms the intact molecular weight. These features are characteristic of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing heterocycles, which often exhibit rich fragmentation patterns due to resonance stabilization of ionic intermediates."

The three equivalent methyl groups produce a single cross-peak due to symmetry. - Peaks in the 1.5–3.5 ppm (1H) and 20–50 ppm (13C) range arise from CH2 groups in the piperidine and indoline rings. The piperidine CH2 groups adjacent to the Boc-protected nitrogen exhibit moderate deshielding (1H ~2.5–3.5 ppm, 13C ~40–50 ppm), while more remote CH2 groups appear upfield (1H ~1.5–2.5 ppm, 13C ~20–35 ppm). 2. **Aromatic Region (1H: 6–9 ppm; 13C: 110–140 ppm):** - Peaks in the 7.0–8.5 ppm (1H) and 120–140 ppm (13C) range correspond to protonated carbons in the pyridine and indoline aromatic systems. The pyridine ring (c2ncccc2) contributes correlations for positions 4, 5, and 6 (1H ~7.5–8.5 ppm, 13C ~125–135 ppm), with the most downfield proton (1H ~8.5 ppm) likely at position 6 due to proximity to the electron-withdrawing nitrogen. - The indoline benzene ring (c3ccccc32) shows peaks in the 6.5–7.5 ppm (1H) and 110–130 ppm (13C) range, with symmetry reducing the number of distinct correlations. 3. **Quaternary Carbon Considerations:** - Quaternary carbons (e.g., Boc carbonyl at ~155 ppm, pyridine C2 and C3) lack proton correlations and are absent in the HSQC spectrum, as expected. Overall, the HSQC spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of Boc, piperidine, pyridine, and indoline moieties through characteristic chemical shifts and coupling patterns.

The peak at m/z 142 likely arises from the loss of the benzyl group (91) from the molecular ion, yielding a fragment containing the ethyl carbamate and cyclohexane ring. The ion at m/z 180 may result from the retention of the benzyl carbamate and ketal groups after fragmentation of the cyclohexane ring. Additional peaks at m/z 186, 247, and 258 correspond to partial fragmentation of the ketal and cyclohexane ring systems, with possible contributions from rearrangements or hydrogen migrations. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 320 confirms the molecular weight of the compound. The spectrum reflects the structural features of the molecule, including the benzyl carbamate (responsible for the tropylium ion) and the ketal-protected cyclohexane ring (contributing to higher-mass fragments). These observations align with the expected fragmentation patterns of nitrogen- and oxygen-rich functionalities under electron ionization."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances consistent with the structural features of the compound. The most downfield peak, observed near 160 ppm, corresponds to the carbonyl carbon of the amide group in the piperazine ring, while the adjacent resonance around 155 ppm is attributed to the carbonyl carbon of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group. Aromatic carbons of the pyrazole ring (n1ccc(n1)) appear as three distinct peaks in the 100–130 ppm range, reflecting the electronic environment of the nitrogen-substituted heterocycle. A singlet near 70 ppm arises from the oxygen-bearing carbon of the Boc group, while the tert-butyl methyl carbons generate a sharp peak at ~28 ppm due to their equivalent chemical environments. The methylene carbons of the piperazine ring are observed as two overlapping resonances near 45 ppm, indicative of their proximity to both the amide and Boc-substituted nitrogens. The methyl group attached to the pyrazole nitrogen (Cn1ccc...) resonates at ~35 ppm, consistent with its aliphatic character. Notably, the absence of peaks below 20 ppm confirms the lack of additional aliphatic substituents. The spectrum’s peak count (eight distinct resonances) aligns with the molecule’s symmetry, as the tert-butyl group and pyrazole ring reduce the number of unique carbon environments. This spectral pattern provides clear evidence for the proposed structure, validating the presence of the Boc-protected piperazine-2,4-dione moiety linked to a methylpyrazole ring."

The spectrum displays six distinct peaks, indicating the presence of six unique carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak, located near 60 ppm, corresponds to the carbon atom directly bonded to the hydroxyl group (CH2OH), as oxygen deshields adjacent carbons, shifting their signals to higher ppm values. A prominent peak near 50 ppm is attributed to the carbon atom bonded to the nitrogen atom in the bicyclic ring system, reflecting the moderate deshielding effect of the nitrogen. Three peaks in the 20–30 ppm range correspond to aliphatic carbons within the saturated ring structures, typical for sp³-hybridized carbons in nonpolar environments. The tallest peak at ~20 ppm likely represents two equivalent carbons in symmetric positions within the bicyclic framework, suggesting a degree of structural symmetry. The absence of peaks above 100 ppm confirms the lack of sp²-hybridized carbons (e.g., carbonyl or aromatic groups), consistent with the molecular formula and the presence of only single bonds. The observed chemical shifts and peak multiplicities align with the proposed bicyclic structure, where the hydroxyl and amine functional groups create distinct electronic environments for the surrounding carbons. This spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule's connectivity and symmetry, supporting the assigned structure of a hydroxylated bicyclic amine."

Key features include a prominent singlet at ~10.5 ppm, which corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH) deshielded by the electronegative oxygen atoms. Aromatic protons from the phenyl ring (-c1ccccc1) appear as a multiplet between ~7.2–7.8 ppm, with fine splitting indicative of meta- and para-substitution patterns.

This peak serves as the base peak, indicating high stability of the molecular ion under ionization conditions. Several key fragment ions are observed. A cluster of peaks at m/z 233, 234, and 235 suggests the loss of a neutral fragment (265 − 233 = 32 Da), potentially corresponding to the elimination of a CH₃OH group (32 Da) or a combination of smaller fragments (e.g., CO + H₂). The isotopic pattern of chlorine (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl) is evident in the molecular ion and fragments, with a ~3:1 intensity ratio for adjacent peaks differing by 2 m/z units (e.g., 265 and 267). A significant fragment at m/z 120 aligns with the cleavage of the amide bond, yielding a pyridine-derived acyl cation (C₆H₄N₂O⁺: 6×12 + 4×1 + 2×14 + 16 = 120). This is consistent with the stability of aromatic acyl ions. Additional fragments at m/z 119 and 155–157 may arise from further dissociation of the pyridine or benzene rings, possibly involving hydrogen rearrangements or halogen loss. Peaks at m/z 206, 207, and 208 suggest a fragment retaining most of the molecular framework, potentially formed via loss of a small neutral species (e.g., HCN or CO). The presence of fluorine (¹⁹F) is indirectly supported by the absence of significant fluorine-related isotopic splitting, as fluorine has a single stable isotope. Overall, the fragmentation pattern reflects the structural features of the molecule: a halogenated aromatic system linked to an N-methyl amide group. The spectrum demonstrates characteristic behavior of such compounds under mass spectrometry, including amide bond cleavage, halogen isotope effects, and stable aromatic cation formation."

The spectrum displays five distinct peaks corresponding to the carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak at approximately 200 ppm is characteristic of the carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the acetyl group, which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen atom. Moving upfield, the aromatic region (150–100 ppm) contains three peaks: a prominent signal near 150 ppm, a smaller peak around 130 ppm, and a sharp resonance at ~110 ppm. These correspond to the substituted aromatic carbons. The peak at 150 ppm likely arises from the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group (C–OH), as oxygen substituents strongly deshield adjacent carbons. The signal near 130 ppm may correspond to the carbon bonded to bromine (C–Br), as halogens also induce downfield shifts, though to a lesser extent than oxygen. The peak at 110 ppm is attributed to the carbon directly bonded to fluorine (C–F), which experiences a moderate deshielded environment due to fluorine's high electronegativity. Finally, the intense peak near 0 ppm represents the methyl group (CH3) of the acetyl moiety, which is shielded due to its sp³ hybridization and proximity to the electron-donating methyl protons. The absence of additional peaks suggests symmetry or overlapping chemical environments in the aromatic ring, though the molecule’s substitution pattern (Br, F, OH, and acetyl groups) typically reduces symmetry. This spectrum aligns with the expected electronic effects of the substituents, with clear differentiation between aliphatic, carbonyl, and aromatic carbon signals."

The base peak at m/z 381 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions used. Key fragment ions are observed at m/z 339, 367, 188, 159, 173, and 145. The peak at m/z 339 (381 – 42) suggests a loss of a propyl group (C3H6), likely originating from the terminal propylamino substituent (CCCN-) in the structure. The fragment at m/z 367 (381 – 14) may correspond to the loss of a methylene group (CH2), potentially from the aliphatic chain or ring system. The intense peak at m/z 188 represents a significant fragmentation event, likely arising from cleavage of the molecule into a core heterocyclic fragment. This could correspond to the thienopyrimidine moiety (C8H8N3S) or a related structure retaining the sulfur atom and adjacent rings. Additional fragments at m/z 159 and 173 may derive from further breakdown of the piperazine-cyanophenyl group (N2CCN(c3ccc(C#N)cc3)), with m/z 159 potentially representing the cyanophenylpiperazine fragment (C11H12N4). The peak at m/z 145 might originate from the pyrimidine-thiophene core (C6H5N3S), reflecting the stability of aromatic heterocycles under fragmentation. Smaller peaks at m/z 120, 131, and 146 could correspond to smaller aromatic or aliphatic fragments, such as the cyanophenyl group (C6H4CN) or partial ring structures. The presence of sulfur is evidenced by the retention of sulfur-containing fragments (e.g., m/z 188, 173), as sulfur often stabilizes charged species in mass spectrometry. Overall, the fragmentation pattern supports the structural features of the molecule, including the propylamino group, piperazine-linked cyanophenyl substituent, and fused thienopyrimidine core.

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks characteristic of the molecular structure. The most prominent signal appears at approximately 5.3 ppm, which is indicative of protons in a highly deshielded environment. This likely corresponds to the methylene (CH2) group adjacent to the oxygen atom in the methoxyethyl substituent (-OCH2CH2-), as the electronegative oxygen and proximity to the electron-withdrawing benzotriazole ring and carbonyl chloride group can significantly downfield-shift these protons. Additional aromatic proton signals are observed in the range of 6.9–7.8 ppm. These peaks arise from the benzotriazole ring system, where the fused benzene ring contributes to the aromatic region. The splitting pattern and chemical shifts suggest a substituted benzene derivative, consistent with the molecular framework. The presence of two distinct aromatic signals (e.g., at ~7.8 ppm and ~6.9 ppm) may reflect non-equivalent proton environments due to the substitution pattern of the benzotriazole ring, including the electron-withdrawing carbonyl chloride group at the 1-position and the methoxyethyl chain at the adjacent nitrogen. A minor peak near 10.5 ppm could correspond to a residual solvent impurity (e.g., formic acid or water) or a trace decomposition product, as the molecule lacks functional groups typically associated with such high chemical shifts (e.g., aldehydes or carboxylic acids). Similarly, the very small signal at ~12 ppm is likely an artifact or impurity, as no acidic protons (e.g., -COOH) are present in the structure. The absence of signals in the 1–4 ppm range suggests minimal contribution from aliphatic protons beyond the methoxyethyl group, aligning with the molecular formula. The carbonyl chloride group (-C(=O)Cl) does not directly contribute to the H-NMR spectrum but influences the electronic environment of adjacent protons. Overall, the spectrum reflects the structural features of the benzotriazole core, methoxyethyl substituent, and carbonyl chloride functional group, with chemical shifts and intensities consistent with the proposed molecular architecture."

A prominent peak at ~10 ppm may arise from aromatic protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing lactam carbonyl group in the fused tricyclic system. Multiple peaks in the 7.0–8.5 ppm range reflect the aromatic protons on the benzene rings, with varying chemical shifts caused by differences in their electronic environments—some influenced by the benzodioxole moiety (O–CH2–O) and others by the indole-like lactam system. A distinct peak at ~4.5 ppm suggests the presence of methylene protons (–CH2–) in the benzodioxole ring (O–CH2–C), which are deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atoms. Additional methylene protons from the –CH2– group linking the aromatic ring to the lactam nitrogen may contribute to peaks near 3.5–4.0 ppm. The N-methyl group (–N–CH3) appears as a singlet around 2.5–3.0 ppm, consistent with its typical shielding in amide environments.

No peaks are observed for carbonyl carbons (ester or carboxylic acid) due to the absence of directly attached protons. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected structural motifs, including the tert-butyl ester, fluorinated aromatic system, and methylenedioxy group."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C16H13FN2O2 (SMILES: COC(=O)c1nn(Cc2ccccc2F)c2ccccc12). The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, consistent with the molecular structure. The most prominent peak at ~50 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (COOCH3) of the ester moiety, which typically appears in the 45–60 ppm region due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carbonyl group. A sharp, intense resonance near 160 ppm is attributed to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ester, which is deshielded by the electronegative oxygen atom. In the aromatic region (100–150 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the complex substitution pattern of the molecule. The two benzene rings (one fluorinated and one fused to the indazole core) generate distinct carbon environments. The fluorine substituent on the benzyl group (Cc2ccccc2F) induces a downfield shift (~10–20 ppm) for the adjacent aromatic carbons due to its strong electronegativity, likely contributing to peaks near 130–140 ppm. The fused indazole ring system (c2ccccc12) exhibits resonances in the 110–130 ppm range, typical for sp²-hybridized aromatic carbons. Additional peaks between 120–130 ppm may correspond to quaternary carbons in the indazole and fluorinated benzyl groups, which lack directly attached protons and thus appear as sharper signals. The absence of signals below 40 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic CH2 or CH3 groups beyond the methyl ester. The overall spectral pattern aligns with the expected structural features, including the ester functionality, aromatic systems, and fluorine-induced deshielding effects. This analysis supports the assigned molecular formula and connectivity."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C8H11NS (SMILES: CCc1ccc(SC)cn1). The spectrum displays eight distinct peaks corresponding to the eight unique carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak, observed near 160 ppm, is characteristic of the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen in the pyridine ring (C2), which experiences strong deshielding due to the electronegative nitrogen and aromatic ring current. Additional aromatic carbons appear between 125–140 ppm, reflecting the substituted pyridine ring’s electron density distribution. The peak near 140 ppm likely corresponds to the carbon bonded to the ethyl group (C3), while the peak at ~130 ppm may represent the carbon attached to the methylthio (-SCH3) group (C5). The remaining aromatic carbons (C4 and C6) resonate between 120–130 ppm, consistent with their positions relative to substituents. In the aliphatic region, the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) produces two peaks: a triplet near 25 ppm for the methylene (CH2) carbon and a quartet near 10 ppm for the terminal methyl (CH3) carbon, though these may overlap slightly due to similar chemical shifts. The methylthio group (-SCH3) contributes a peak near 20 ppm, reflecting the shielding effect of the sulfur atom. Notably, two closely spaced peaks near 0 ppm are observed, which may arise from rapid rotation or subtle conformational effects in the -SCH3 group, though such low shifts are atypical and could indicate minor impurities or solvent interactions. The spectrum confirms the presence of all eight carbons: five in the pyridine ring (including substituted positions), two in the ethyl chain, and one in the methylthio group. The chemical shifts align with expected trends for aromatic, heteroatom-substituted, and aliphatic carbons, validating the proposed structure."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts for protonated carbons in the molecule. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic region (¹H 7–8 ppm; ¹³C 120–160 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to aromatic protons and their attached carbons. The pyridine ring (ncccc3Cl) contributes to these signals, with the chlorine substituent causing deshielding of adjacent protons, evident in the downfield ¹H shifts. The triazole and pyrimidine rings in the structure likely account for additional aromatic correlations. 2. **Aliphatic region (¹H 1–2 ppm; ¹³C 20–40 ppm):** A prominent cross-peak near ¹H 1.3 ppm and ¹³C 28 ppm is consistent with the tert-butyl group (C(CH₃)₃), where the methyl protons couple to their respective carbons. 3. **Fluorinated cyclopropane moiety:** The N2CCC(F)(F)C2 group introduces fluorine atoms, which may indirectly influence the chemical shifts of nearby protons and carbons. However, the CF₂ carbons are not directly observed in HSQC due to the absence of attached protons. 4. **High-field ¹H shifts (¹H ~12 ppm):** A cross-peak at ¹H ~12 ppm (¹³C ~150 ppm) suggests a deshielded proton, potentially from a nitrogen-adjacent carbon in the heterocyclic framework (e.g., a triazole or pyrimidine proton). 5. **Quaternary carbons:** Peaks in the ¹³C range of 150–160 ppm without corresponding ¹H signals likely correspond to non-protonated aromatic carbons, such as those bonded to chlorine or nitrogen atoms. The HSQC spectrum confirms the presence of protonated carbons in both aliphatic and aromatic environments, aligning with the structural features of the molecule. The observed correlations provide insights into the connectivity and electronic environment of the heterocyclic and substituent groups."

The most downfield peak, appearing near 160 ppm, corresponds to the carbon atom directly bonded to the chlorine substituent on the pyridazine ring (Clc1ccc...nn1), as electronegative atoms like chlorine deshield adjacent carbons. Additional aromatic carbons from both the pyridazine and phenyl rings (Cc4ccccc4) are evident in the 120–140 ppm region, with their exact positions influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of nitrogen atoms in the heterocycle and the electron-donating benzyl group. A prominent peak near 60 ppm likely arises from the methylene carbon (CH2) bridging the benzyl group to the tertiary nitrogen atom, as carbons attached to nitrogen typically resonate in the 40–70 ppm range due to deshielding by the electronegative nitrogen. The bicyclic amine system (N2CC3CCCC(CN...C3)C2) contributes multiple peaks between 30–50 ppm, corresponding to aliphatic carbons in the cyclohexane-like ring and the adjacent carbons bonded to nitrogen. These shifts are consistent with saturated carbons in a rigid, sterically constrained environment. The upfield region (0–30 ppm) shows weaker signals, likely from methyl or methylene groups in the aliphatic framework, though their low intensity suggests fewer equivalent carbons or overlap with other resonances. The absence of peaks above 180 ppm confirms the lack of carbonyl or carboxyl groups in the structure. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected chemical environment of a polycyclic amine-containing compound with aromatic and aliphatic domains, providing clear evidence for the molecular framework defined by the SMILES notation."

A broad, moderate-intensity band near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of N–H stretching vibrations from the indole moiety, while sharp peaks between 2900–3000 cm⁻¹ are attributed to C–H stretching modes of aromatic and aliphatic hydrogens. The absence of a strong carbonyl (C=O) absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of ketone or ester groups in the structure.

The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, reflecting the molecule’s complex aromatic and aliphatic environments. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8.5 ppm):** Multiple sharp peaks between 7.0–8.5 ppm correspond to protons on the benzoxazole ring (c2noc3cc(F)ccc23) and the chlorophenyl group (c2cccc(Cl)c2). The fluorine substituent on the benzoxazole induces deshielding, shifting adjacent protons downfield (e.g., ~8.0–8.5 ppm). Peaks near 7.5 ppm likely arise from protons on the central benzene ring (c1ccc(-c2noc3cc(F)ccc23)cc1), with splitting patterns influenced by coupling to neighboring protons and the electron-withdrawing oxazole group. 2. **High-Field Aromatic/Aliphatic Overlap (4–6 ppm):** A cluster of peaks between 4.5–6.0 ppm includes resonances from the benzylic CH2 group (OCH2) adjacent to the oxygen atom, typically shifted downfield due to electronegative effects. The hydroxyl proton (OH) may appear as a broad singlet near 4.5–5.5 ppm, though its exact position is often solvent-dependent. 3. **Aliphatic Region (1–4 ppm):** Peaks in this range correspond to the piperidine ring (CN1CCC(Oc2cccc(Cl)c2)CC1) and the CH2 group linked to the hydroxyl-bearing carbon. The piperidine protons exhibit multiplets due to ring strain and coupling with adjacent CH2 groups, with shifts influenced by the electron-donating oxygen substituent (Oc2cccc(Cl)c2). The CH2 group adjacent to the oxygen (OCH2) likely resonates near 3.5–4.0 ppm, while the CH2 group near the nitrogen (CN1CCC) appears slightly upfield (~2.5–3.0 ppm). 4. **Low-Intensity Peaks (10–12 ppm):** A singlet near 10–12 ppm may indicate a proton involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding, such as the hydroxyl proton or an aromatic proton near the oxazole nitrogen. However, such high-field shifts are atypical for this molecule, suggesting possible solvent interactions or dynamic exchange effects. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s multiple aromatic systems, heteroatoms (F, Cl, O, N), and stereocenters, which create diverse electronic environments. Integration ratios align with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of 26 protons. Coupling patterns (e.g., doublets, triplets) in the aromatic region further support the substitution patterns on the benzene rings.

These signals indicate sp²-hybridized carbons with attached protons, consistent with the conjugated heterocyclic and aromatic systems in the molecule. In the aliphatic region (0–4 ppm for ¹H; 10–60 ppm for ¹³C), prominent peaks arise from the ethyl group (CCN), the cyclohexylamine moiety ([C@@H]1CC[C@@H](N)CC1), and methyl substituents (CC(C)=C1).

The most prominent peak at 6.0 ppm is a singlet with the highest intensity, likely representing the four aromatic protons of the tosyl group (para-substituted benzene ring), which are typically observed as two doublets in the 7.5–8.0 ppm range but may overlap here due to symmetry or resolution limits. A sharp peak at 4.0 ppm, with moderate intensity, corresponds to the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the oxygen atom in the –CH2OSO2– linker, deshielded by the electronegative sulfonyl group. The methoxy group (OCH3) attached to the pyridine ring appears as a singlet near 3.5–4.0 ppm, potentially overlapping with the methylene signal. A peak at 8.0 ppm, with intermediate intensity, is assigned to the pyridine ring protons. The pyridine ring has three protons: one adjacent to the methoxy group (position 3), one near the CH2OSO2– substituent (position 6), and one at position 4.

A sharp, strong peak at ~3300 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the N-H stretching vibration of the secondary amide group. The prominent absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching mode of the amide, slightly shifted to higher wavenumber due to conjugation with the adjacent aromatic system. Aromatic C-H stretching vibrations are evident as sharp peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹, while aliphatic C-H stretches from the tetrahydropyran ring and methyl group appear below 3000 cm⁻¹. The broad band at ~1600 cm⁻¹ arises from C=C stretching in the aromatic rings, including contributions from the chlorinated benzene and pyrazole moieties. Multiple absorptions in the 1200–1000 cm⁻¹ region are assigned to C-O stretching vibrations from the ether linkages in the benzofuran and tetrahydropyran groups. A distinct peak near 800 cm⁻¹ likely corresponds to C-Cl stretching, consistent with the presence of a chloro substituent on the aromatic ring. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex, overlapping bands from skeletal vibrations of the polycyclic framework.

Key observations include: 1. **Aromatic Region (¹H: 7–8 ppm; ¹³C: 120–140 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to aromatic protons and their attached carbons on the benzene ring. The bromine substituent deshields adjacent protons, shifting their signals downfield. The fused bicyclic system (chromene derivative) likely causes slight variations in chemical shifts due to ring current effects and electronic asymmetry. 2. **Aliphatic Region (¹H: 1–2 ppm; ¹³C: 20–40 ppm):** Peaks here arise from the pentyl chain (CCCCC) and the two methyl groups (C(C)(C)) attached to the dihydrofuran ring. The methyl groups exhibit upfield shifts due to their saturated nature, while the methylene (CH₂) protons in the chain appear slightly downfield due to proximity to the ring system. 3. **Oxygen-Adjacent Carbon (¹³C: ~100 ppm):** A cross-peak near 100 ppm in the ¹³C dimension likely corresponds to the carbon adjacent to the oxygen in the dihydrofuran ring. This carbon is part of a double bond (C=C) in the ring, explaining its deshielded shift compared to typical aliphatic carbons. 4. **Deshielded Proton (¹H: ~10 ppm):** A distinct cross-peak at ~10 ppm (¹H) and ~160 ppm (¹³C) suggests a proton attached to a highly deshielded carbon. This may correspond to the vinylic proton on the dihydrofuran ring, influenced by the electron-withdrawing oxygen and the fused aromatic system. The spectrum confirms the presence of aromatic, aliphatic, and oxygenated environments consistent with the given structure. The absence of peaks in certain regions (e.g., carbonyl carbons) aligns with the molecular formula and SMILES notation, reinforcing the absence of ketone or ester functionalities. This HSQC data, combined with the molecular framework, supports the identification of a brominated chromene derivative with a pentyl substituent and geminal methyl groups."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates 1H and 13C chemical shifts for directly bonded proton-carbon pairs, providing critical insights into the molecular structure. The 1H chemical shifts are displayed on the x-axis (ppm), while the 13C chemical shifts are shown on the y-axis (ppm). Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (1H 6–8 ppm, 13C 110–160 ppm):** A cluster of cross-peaks in this region corresponds to the aromatic protons and carbons in the molecule. The aromatic systems include the fluorinated phenyl ring (Oc4cccc(F)c4) and the pyridine ring (c2cnc...c2). The fluorine substituent on the phenyl ring induces a downfield shift in adjacent carbons and protons, consistent with the observed chemical shifts. The pyridine ring’s nitrogen also contributes to deshielding, with the adjacent carbons appearing in the 150–160 ppm range. 2. **Aliphatic Region (1H 1–3 ppm, 13C 20–60 ppm):** Peaks in this region arise from the aliphatic methylene groups in the piperidine ring (C1CCCN) and the propyl chain of the acrylamide substituent (C=CC(=O)NC1). The piperidine ring’s protons show moderate dispersion due to their proximity to the nitrogen atom, which affects their chemical environment. 3. **Carbonyl Region (13C ~170 ppm, 1H 6–8 ppm):** A distinct cross-peak near 13C 170 ppm correlates with a 1H signal at ~8 ppm, indicative of an amide proton (C=O-NH). This corresponds to the pyridine carboxamide group (c(C(N)=O)c2) and the acrylamide group (C=CC(=O)NC1), both of which contribute to this region. 4. **Olefinic Region (1H 5–6 ppm, 13C 120–140 ppm):** The acrylamide group (C=CC(=O)N) produces cross-peaks in this region, reflecting the vinylic protons and their attached carbons. The trans configuration of the double bond may lead to slight splitting or coupling patterns, though these are not resolved in the 2D HSQC projection.

The HSQC data aids in assigning proton-carbon pairs, which is essential for validating the proposed structure and understanding electronic effects (e.g., fluorine’s deshielding influence, amide resonance). No unexpected peaks are observed, supporting the purity of the sample and the accuracy of the structural assignment."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent feature is a high-intensity peak at ~50 ppm, corresponding to the methylene carbons (-CH2-) in the piperazine ring (N2CCN and N4CCN), which are typically observed in this region due to their proximity to electronegative nitrogen atoms. A sharp peak near 0 ppm is attributed to the two methyl groups (-CH3) attached to the pyridine ring (positions 3 and 5 in the SMILES notation), which are shielded by the aromatic system. In the aromatic region (100–150 ppm), multiple peaks are evident. The signal at ~150 ppm arises from the carbonyl carbons in the amide (C=O) and urea-like (N4CCNC4=O) functional groups, which resonate downfield due to deshielding by adjacent oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Peaks between 100–130 ppm correspond to the aromatic carbons of the pyridine and benzene rings, including the cyano-substituted carbon (C#N) in the benzene ring, which typically appears near 110–120 ppm. The cyano group itself (C#N) contributes a distinct peak at ~115 ppm, consistent with its triple-bonded nature. Additional smaller peaks in the 20–40 ppm range may originate from minor conformational variations or overlapping signals of aliphatic carbons in the piperazine ring. The absence of peaks above 180 ppm confirms the lack of aldehyde or ketone functionalities, while the defined splitting pattern in the aromatic region reflects the substitution pattern of the pyridine and benzene rings. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the structural complexity of the molecule, showcasing contributions from aromatic, aliphatic, carbonyl, and nitrile carbons as dictated by the SMILES notation."

The base peak (most intense signal) appears at *m/z* 155, indicating a highly stable fragment, likely formed via cleavage adjacent to the carbonyl groups or the sulfonate ester linkage. Key isotopic patterns are evident, such as the *m/z* 107 and 109 doublet, which reflect the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl). Similarly, peaks at *m/z* 263, 265, and 267 exhibit a 3:2:1 ratio, characteristic of fragments containing two chlorine atoms. The peak at *m/z* 125 may arise from a benzoyl fragment (C₇H₄ClO⁺), while *m/z* 139 could represent a tropylium ion derivative. Fragmentation at *m/z* 209 and 233 suggests retention of the sulfonate group (O=S=O), as these peaks align with partial structures retaining the aromatic ring and sulfonyl moiety. The peak at *m/z* 243 may correspond to a loss of water (H₂O) from a larger fragment, while *m/z* 281 and 341 could result from sequential losses of small neutral molecules (e.g., CO, SO₂) from the molecular ion. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s structural features: a cyclohexane ring with two ketone groups, a chlorinated aromatic ring, and a sulfonate ester. The observed fragments align with typical cleavage pathways for carbonyl-rich systems and sulfonate esters, including α-cleavage, McLafferty rearrangements, and sulfonate group dissociation. These data collectively validate the proposed molecular structure and its fragmentation behavior under mass spectrometry conditions."

The spectrum displays correlations between proton and carbon chemical shifts, revealing key structural features of the molecule. The most prominent peaks are observed in three distinct regions. First, a cluster of signals near 7.3 ppm (¹H) and 128 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the aromatic protons and carbons of the benzyl ester group. These shifts are characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring, consistent with the phenyl group in the SMILES notation. Second, a strong cross-peak at ~5.2 ppm (¹H) and ~66 ppm (¹³C) arises from the benzylic methylene group (CH₂-O), where the proton resonance is deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom, and the carbon shift reflects its connection to both the ester carbonyl and the aromatic ring. Third, two distinct correlations in the aliphatic region at ~2.5 ppm (¹H) and ~30 ppm (¹³C), as well as ~1.8 ppm (¹H) and ~25 ppm (¹³C), correspond to the diastereotopic protons of the cyclopropane ring. The splitting of these signals reflects the stereochemical environment imposed by the adjacent stereocenters (C[C@H] and C[C@@H] in the SMILES), which creates distinct electronic environments for each proton. Notably, the carboxylic acid proton (COOH) is not directly observable in the HSQC spectrum due to rapid exchange in typical NMR solvents, though its carbonyl carbon (~175 ppm) may appear as a weak or absent signal due to relaxation effects. The absence of peaks in the 10–12 ppm (¹H) region further supports the lack of observable exchangeable protons.

The spectrum displays characteristic proton resonances across a wide chemical shift range (0–14 ppm), reflecting the molecule's diverse structural motifs. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm):** - A prominent singlet at **~8.0 ppm** corresponds to the pyrazole ring proton (H-5) adjacent to the fluorine substituent, which deshields the proton via inductive effects. - Multiplets between **7.2–7.8 ppm** arise from the aromatic protons on the benzene ring (H-6, H-7, H-8, H-9), split by the electron-withdrawing pyrazole and alkyne substituents. The substitution pattern (para to the alkyne and fused to the pyrazole) creates a non-symmetric environment, leading to complex splitting. 2. **Heterocyclic and Aliphatic Regions (3–5 ppm):** - A broad multiplet at **~4.8 ppm** is assigned to the methine proton (H-2') on the tetrahydropyran (THP) ring adjacent to the oxygen atom, which experiences moderate deshielding. - Peaks at **3.5–4.0 ppm** correspond to the THP ring’s methylene protons (H-3', H-6'), which are split by coupling with neighboring protons. 3. **Alkyne and Cyclobutyl Protons (1–3 ppm):** - A triplet at **~2.8 ppm** (J ~ 7 Hz) and a quartet at **~2.0 ppm** (J ~ 7 Hz) are attributed to the methylene groups (H-1'' and H-2'') adjacent to the internal alkyne (C#C). The alkyne’s anisotropic shielding slightly deshields these protons. - The cyclobutyl ring (C3CCC3) produces overlapping multiplets between **1.5–2.2 ppm**, reflecting its conformational rigidity and coupling patterns. 4. **High-Field Region (<2 ppm):** - A sharp singlet at **~1.2 ppm** likely represents the remaining THP methylene protons (H-4', H-5') in a symmetric environment. 5. **Anomalous Peaks (9–12 ppm):** - Peaks at **~11.5 ppm** and **~12.2 ppm** are atypically downfield and may indicate trace impurities (e.g., residual solvent or degradation products), as the molecule lacks acidic protons (e.g., -OH, -NH) that typically resonate in this range. The spectrum’s integration and splitting patterns align with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of the fluorinated pyrazole, THP-protected heterocycle, aromatic system, and cyclobutyl-alkyne moiety. The fluorine atom’s electronegativity and the alkyne’s anisotropy significantly influence the chemical shifts of nearby protons, as observed."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks that correlate with the structural features of the compound. The most prominent peak appears as a singlet at approximately 7.5 ppm, corresponding to the aromatic protons of the benzothiazole ring. This downfield shift is characteristic of protons in an aromatic system, particularly influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent sulfur and nitrogen atoms in the thiazole ring. The amino group (-NH2) at position 6 of the benzene ring may further deshield neighboring aromatic protons, though their exact splitting pattern may be obscured by overlap or symmetry. A triplet at ~4.5 ppm (integration ~2H) is attributed to the methylene group (CH2) directly attached to the benzothiazole ring. This deshielding arises from the proximity to the electron-deficient thiazole moiety. Adjacent to this, a quintet at ~2.5 ppm (integration ~2H) and another quintet at ~1.8 ppm (integration ~2H) correspond to the middle two methylene groups in the butyl chain (-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CN). These peaks exhibit coupling patterns consistent with their positions in the aliphatic chain. The terminal methylene group adjacent to the nitrile (-CH2-CN) appears as a triplet at ~3.5 ppm (integration ~2H), reflecting deshielding by the electron-withdrawing nitrile group. A small peak near ~1.0 ppm (integration ~3H) may indicate residual solvent or impurities, as the molecular formula does not include methyl groups. The absence of broad signals in the 4–5 ppm range suggests that the amino group protons (-NH2) are either exchange-broadened or not resolved under the experimental conditions. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected structure, with distinct regions for aromatic, aliphatic, and nitrile-adjacent protons. The integration and splitting patterns provide clear evidence for the butyl chain connectivity and the functionalized benzothiazole core."

The quaternary carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (CCCC(O)(CCC)...) does not produce an HSQC peak, as it lacks directly attached protons. However, its presence is inferred from the absence of correlations in the ¹³C region ~70–80 ppm, where oxygenated carbons typically resonate. The spectrum also lacks peaks in the 3–4 ppm range for ¹H, confirming the absence of protons on carbons directly bonded to oxygen (e.g., no CH-O groups). Overall, the HSQC data aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the aldehyde, aromatic, and aliphatic regions while corroborating the molecule’s thioether linkage and hydroxyl-bearing quaternary carbon."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H13NO3 (SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)C(C(=O)O)c1ccccc1). The spectrum displays four distinct cross-peaks, correlating proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts through direct one-bond couplings. The aromatic region shows two prominent peaks: one at approximately 7.3 ppm (¹H) / 130 ppm (¹³C), corresponding to the ortho/para protons and carbons of the benzene ring, and another at 7.3 ppm (¹H) / 130 ppm (¹³C), reflecting the meta positions. A high-field cross-peak at 3.1 ppm (¹H) / 40 ppm (¹³C) arises from the N-methyl groups (N(CH₃)₂), which exhibit strong shielding due to their electron-donating nature. A low-field cross-peak at 4.0 ppm (¹H) / 60 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methine proton (CH) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group (C(=O)O), where deshielding occurs due to the electronegative oxygen. The carbonyl carbons (C=O) of the amide and carboxylic acid groups are absent in the HSQC, as expected, since they lack directly attached protons. The spectrum confirms the presence of aromatic, aliphatic, and functionalized carbons in the structure, with chemical shifts consistent with the assigned molecular framework."

The spectrum exhibits several distinct absorption bands characteristic of its functional groups and structural features. A broad, intense peak near 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of N–H stretching vibrations, likely from the secondary amide group (O=C–NH–) in the molecule. This band is broadened due to hydrogen bonding interactions, a common feature in amide-containing compounds. Adjacent to this, a sharp peak at ~3300 cm⁻¹ may correspond to aromatic C–H stretching vibrations from the pyridine, pyrimidine, or phenyl rings in the structure. In the 3000–2800 cm⁻¹ region, multiple sharp peaks are observed, consistent with aliphatic C–H stretching vibrations from the piperazine ring (N1CCNCC1) and other saturated carbon centers. The absence of strong absorptions near 2200 cm⁻¹ indicates no significant contributions from nitrile (C≡N) or alkyne (C≡C) groups, aligning with the molecular formula. A prominent peak at ~1600 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the amide group. This absorption is slightly shifted to lower wavenumbers compared to typical amides, potentially due to conjugation with the adjacent aromatic systems or hydrogen bonding. Additional peaks in the 1500–1400 cm⁻¹ range correspond to aromatic C=C stretching vibrations from the heterocyclic and phenyl rings, which are integral to the molecule’s structure. The region below 1300 cm⁻¹ shows complex patterns, including a strong absorption near 1100 cm⁻¹, which may arise from C–N stretching vibrations in the piperazine or pyrimidine rings. Peaks near 800–700 cm⁻¹ are indicative of out-of-plane C–H bending vibrations in the aromatic rings, providing further evidence of the substituted phenyl and heteroaromatic moieties. Notably, the spectrum lacks significant absorptions in the 2500–2000 cm⁻¹ range, ruling out alkyne or isocyanate functionalities. The fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring (–c3c(F)cccc3F) do not produce distinct IR-active peaks in this spectrum, as C–F stretching vibrations typically appear in the 1400–1000 cm⁻¹ region and may overlap with other signals. Overall, the IR spectrum aligns with the expected vibrational modes of the described molecule, confirming the presence of amide, aromatic, and aliphatic functional groups."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts, providing insights into the molecule's structural features. The most prominent peaks are observed in three distinct regions. First, a cluster of signals appears between 7.5–8.5 ppm (¹H) and 120–140 ppm (¹³C), consistent with aromatic protons and their directly bonded carbons. These peaks correspond to the benzene ring in the phthalimide moiety (N2C(=O)c3ccc([N+](=O)[O-])cc3C2=O), where the nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]) induces strong deshielding, shifting the aromatic protons downfield. Second, a group of peaks between 3–4 ppm (¹H) and 40–60 ppm (¹³C) reflects aliphatic methylene (CH₂) groups in the piperidine ring (CCN1CCCC). The proximity of these carbons to the electronegative nitrogen atom explains their moderate downfield shift. Third, a distinct cross-peak near 2.5 ppm (¹H) and ~170 ppm (¹³C) likely corresponds to a carbonyl carbon (C=O) adjacent to a proton-bearing carbon, though the exact assignment requires further analysis. The absence of peaks in the 0–2 ppm (¹H) and 10–30 ppm (¹³C) regions suggests minimal contribution from isolated aliphatic chains. The spectrum confirms the presence of the phthalimide core, nitro-substituted aromatic system, and piperidine ring, aligning with the provided SMILES structure. The HSQC data effectively maps proton-carbon connectivity, validating the molecular framework and highlighting the electronic effects of functional groups on chemical shifts."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, reflecting the molecule’s structural complexity. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at approximately 10.5 ppm, which is characteristic of a highly deshielded proton, likely arising from a hydroxyl group (OH) involved in strong hydrogen bonding or adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. This is consistent with the two hydroxyl groups in the molecule’s structure (C(O)C(O)), which may experience deshielding due to their proximity to electronegative nitrogen atoms in the benzimidazole rings. A second notable peak appears as a singlet near 7.8 ppm, falling within the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm). This signal likely corresponds to the aromatic protons on the benzimidazole moieties (nc2ccccc21 and nc3ccccc3n2), which typically exhibit downfield shifts due to the electron-deficient nature of the heterocyclic rings. The splitting pattern suggests overlapping signals from equivalent or nearly equivalent protons on the two benzimidazole units. Additional peaks are observed between 3.5–4.5 ppm, which can be attributed to the methoxy (OCH3) and methylene (CH2) groups attached to the benzimidazole nitrogens (COCn and n2COC). These protons are shielded relative to aromatic protons but deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atoms, resulting in their intermediate chemical shifts. The multiplicity of these peaks may reflect coupling between the CH2 and OCH3 protons or slight conformational differences in the substituent orientations. A broad, low-intensity signal near 5.2 ppm could correspond to the hydroxyl protons (C(O)H) or the central methylene (CH2) group in the C(O)C(O) segment, though its exact assignment is complicated by potential hydrogen bonding or exchange broadening. The absence of signals below 2 ppm aligns with the lack of aliphatic alkyl groups in the structure, while the lack of signals above 12 ppm rules out strong acids like carboxylic protons. Overall, the spectrum reflects the molecule’s aromaticity, heterocyclic nitrogen content, and polar functional groups, with key features consistent with the provided molecular formula and SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the unique carbon environments in the structure. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), three prominent peaks are observed. The most downfield peak at ~150 ppm is attributed to the carbon directly bonded to the oxygen atom (C–O) in the phenoxy group, as electronegative oxygen deshields the adjacent carbon. Two additional peaks at ~125 ppm and ~115 ppm correspond to the remaining aromatic carbons, which are influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of the substituents and the ring’s conjugated system. In the aliphatic region (0–100 ppm), a peak at ~70 ppm arises from the methylene carbon (CH2) adjacent to the oxygen atom in the OCCCBr chain, reflecting deshielding by the electronegative oxygen. A peak at ~30 ppm corresponds to the methylene carbon (CH2) bonded to bromine (CH2Br), as bromine’s strong deshielding effect shifts this signal downfield. The propyl group (CCC) attached to the benzene ring exhibits three peaks: ~25 ppm (CH2 adjacent to the ring), ~20 ppm (middle CH2), and ~10 ppm (terminal CH3), consistent with typical alkyl chain shifts. The spectrum’s peak multiplicities and chemical shifts align with the molecular symmetry and substituent effects. For instance, the aromatic region’s three peaks suggest partial symmetry in the benzene ring’s substitution pattern (ortho to the propyl group and para to the OCCCBr chain), while the aliphatic peaks reflect distinct environments for each carbon in the chains. No carbonyl or highly deshielded signals (>160 ppm) are present, confirming the absence of carboxylic acid or ketone functionalities.

The spectrum displays several key features characteristic of this compound. The molecular ion peak [M+H]+ appears at m/z 544, corresponding to the calculated molecular weight of 544.36 g/mol, confirming the intact molecular structure. A prominent peak at m/z 183, representing the base peak (100% relative abundance), likely arises from a stable bromophenyl-containing fragment, such as the benzoyl cation (C6H4BrCO+), formed via cleavage of the amide bond adjacent to the carbonyl group. This fragmentation is consistent with the presence of the 3-bromobenzoyl moiety in the SMILES notation. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 456, 470, and 488, which may correspond to sequential losses of neutral fragments. For instance, the peak at m/z 456 (relative abundance ~40%) could result from the elimination of a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group (C5H9NO2, 125 Da) from the molecular ion, while the peak at m/z 470 (30%) may reflect a similar process involving isotopic contributions from bromine (79Br/81Br). The peak at m/z 488 (20%) might involve the loss of a smaller fragment, such as CO2 (44 Da) or a methyl group (15 Da), from the molecular ion. Isotopic patterns are evident in peaks containing bromine, such as the doublet at m/z 456 and 470 (separated by 14 Da), which aligns with the 79Br/81Br isotopic ratio (~1:1). Peaks at m/z 413, 444, and 472 further suggest complex fragmentation pathways, potentially involving the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group or the dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) substituent. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 100 indicates minimal fragmentation of the core aromatic system. Overall, the spectrum reflects the structural complexity of the molecule, with dominant fragmentation pathways driven by the stability of the bromophenyl and carbonyl-containing fragments. The observed peaks align with the molecular formula and SMILES notation, providing insights into the compound’s mass spectrometric behavior."

The aromatic protons of the benzene ring (c1ccccc1) produce a cluster of peaks between 7.0–7.5 ppm, consistent with the splitting patterns of a monosubstituted benzene ring.

The aliphatic chain contributes a series of overlapping multiplets between 1.0–2.5 ppm, with the methylene protons (-CH2-) adjacent to the carboxylic acid appearing slightly downfield (closer to 2.5 ppm) due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group. The terminal methyl group (-CH3) of the aliphatic chain generates a triplet near 0.8 ppm, split by the adjacent methylene protons. The absence of signals above 8 ppm confirms the lack of aldehyde or strongly deshielded protons, while the integration of peak intensities aligns with the 18-carbon aliphatic chain and aromatic ring system.

The x-axis represents the ¹H chemical shift range (approximately -2 to 14 ppm), while the y-axis corresponds to the ¹³C chemical shift range (approximately 0 to 200 ppm). Each cross-peak in the spectrum indicates a direct ¹H-¹³C coupling, offering insights into the molecular framework. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aldehyde group**: A prominent cross-peak near (δH ~10 ppm, δC ~190 ppm) corresponds to the formyl proton and its attached carbonyl carbon (C=O). This high-field ¹H shift and low-field ¹³C shift are characteristic of an aldehyde functional group. 2. **Aromatic protons and carbons**: Peaks in the region δH 6.5–8.0 ppm correlate with δC 120–140 ppm, indicating sp²-hybridized carbons in the benzene ring (C1–C6 in the SMILES structure).

The isopropyl methyl protons (δH ~1.2 ppm) and their attached carbons (δC ~20 ppm) are distinct, while the tert-butyl group’s methyl carbons appear at higher δC (~28 ppm). 4. **Olefinic signals**: A cross-peak near δH ~5.5 ppm and δC ~125 ppm suggests a proton on a sp² carbon in the cyclopentene ring (C3=CCCC3). This region is consistent with vinylic protons adjacent to a double bond. 5. **Ketone carbonyl**: No cross-peak is observed for the ketone (C=O) at δC ~200 ppm, as it lacks directly bonded protons. The spectrum reflects the molecular complexity, with clear differentiation between aromatic, olefinic, and aliphatic environments. The absence of peaks in regions corresponding to quaternary carbons (e.g., the ketone or oxygen-bearing carbons in the benzofuran ring) aligns with HSQC’s sensitivity to only protonated carbons. This analysis confirms the structural features of the molecule, including the aldehyde, aromatic ring, cyclopentene, isopropyl, and tert-butyl groups, as defined by the provided SMILES notation."

A prominent sharp peak near 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of N-H stretching vibrations, though this is unusual for a tertiary amine (as indicated by the SMILES). This feature may instead arise from an overtone or combination band, or potentially a minor impurity. A series of moderately intense peaks between 3000–3100 cm⁻¹ correspond to aromatic C-H stretching vibrations from the benzene ring and heterocyclic thiazole moiety. The aliphatic C-H stretches from the seven-membered ring appear as weaker absorptions below 3000 cm⁻¹. A strong, broad band near 1600 cm⁻¹ is attributed to C=C stretching in the aromatic rings, consistent with the conjugated π-system of the benzene and thiazole groups. Additional peaks in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) provide further evidence for the molecular structure. A distinct absorption near 1450 cm⁻¹ likely represents C-H bending vibrations from the aliphatic CH₂ groups in the ring. The sharp peak at ~1000 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C-N stretching vibrations from the tertiary amine, while absorptions near 700 cm⁻¹ are consistent with C-S and C-Cl stretching modes, aligning with the sulfur and chlorine substituents in the structure. The absence of significant carbonyl (C=O) or hydroxyl (O-H) bands confirms the lack of such groups in the molecule. Overall, the spectral features correlate well with the proposed structure, highlighting the aromatic, aliphatic, and heteroatom-containing components of the compound."

In the aromatic region (6.5–8.0 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, corresponding to the fluorophenyl (c2ccc(F)cc2) and phenyl (c1ccccc1) groups. The fluorine substituent on the aromatic ring induces splitting patterns and deshielding effects, evident in the multiplets near 7.0–7.5 ppm. A singlet at ~3.8 ppm likely arises from the methoxy group (OC) attached to the fluorophenyl ring, while the broad peak near 4.0 ppm may correspond to the OCH2 protons of the propargyl ether (C#CCO–). The aliphatic region (0.5–3.5 ppm) shows several overlapping signals. The cyclohexyl ring (C1CCCCC1) contributes to the multiplets between 1.0–2.0 ppm, with additional peaks in this range attributed to the ethyl chain (–CH2CH2–) linking the central carbon to the piperazine ring. The piperazine protons (NCH2CH2N) appear as complex multiplets near 2.5–3.0 ppm, influenced by the adjacent nitrogen atoms and the fluorine-substituted aromatic system. A notable sharp peak at ~2.1 ppm may represent the terminal alkyne proton (C≡CH) of the propargyl group. The high-intensity peak at ~6.0 ppm is atypical for this compound and may indicate a residual solvent signal (e.g., water or DMSO-d6) or an artifact, as no proton environment in the given structure aligns with this shift. Integration of the peaks would reflect the relative proton counts: 19 aliphatic/aromatic protons (excluding solvent contributions), 3 methoxy protons, and 1 alkyne proton. The spectrum’s resolution and peak splitting patterns provide insights into the molecule’s conformational dynamics and electronic environment, particularly the influence of the fluorine substituent and heterocyclic piperazine ring on neighboring protons."

Key peaks are observed in the aromatic region (100–150 ppm), the aliphatic region (20–50 ppm), and the carbonyl region (160–170 ppm). The most prominent peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the ester carbonyl carbon (COO), which exhibits a high chemical shift due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent oxygen atoms. A cluster of peaks between 120–140 ppm reflects the aromatic carbons of the benzene and furan rings, with substitution patterns causing deshielding effects. The methoxy groups (-OCH3) attached to the benzene rings appear as sharp peaks near 55 ppm, while the methylene carbon (-CH2-) in the sulfone (C-SO2-) moiety resonates at ~50 ppm, slightly downfield due to the electron-withdrawing sulfone group. Additional peaks in the 100–120 ppm range correspond to the furan ring carbons, which are less deshielded than the benzene carbons due to the oxygen heteroatom's electron-donating resonance effects.

The base peak at m/z 131 (100% relative abundance) corresponds to a stable fragment likely derived from the piperazine ring system with attached carbonyl functionality. A molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at m/z 420, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of C23H25N5O3 (420.20 g/mol), confirming the molecular formula. Key fragment ions include m/z 103 and 104, which may arise from cleavage of the methoxy-substituted aromatic ring or piperazine ring fragmentation. The peak at m/z 132 represents the M+1 isotope peak, indicative of natural isotopic abundance (primarily ¹³C contributions).

Key regions of interest include aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroatom-bearing environments. In the aliphatic region (¹H 0.5–4 ppm, ¹³C 10–70 ppm), distinct cross-peaks are observed for the tert-butyl group (OC(CH₃)₃), which appears as a singlet in the ¹H dimension (~1.3 ppm) and a corresponding ¹³C resonance near 28 ppm, consistent with equivalent methyl carbons. The methoxy group (OCH₃) of the ester moiety exhibits a cross-peak at ~3.6 ppm (¹H) and ~52 ppm (¹³C), typical for methyl ethers. The benzyl methylene (CH₂) adjacent to the nitrogen shows a correlation near 3.0 ppm (¹H) and 40 ppm (¹³C), while the α-proton of the central chiral center (CH) appears as a doublet in the ¹H dimension (~4.5 ppm) with a ¹³C shift near 55 ppm, reflecting its attachment to electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms.

The most downfield peak at ~180 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the amide group, which is highly deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen and resonance effects. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~160 ppm is attributed to the imine carbon (N=C) in the central heterocyclic ring, which is also deshielded by the adjacent nitrogen. Three peaks in the 130–140 ppm range arise from aromatic carbons in the thiazole ring (Cc2ccsc2), where the electron-withdrawing sulfur and nitrogen atoms shift these signals downfield. The peak at ~110 ppm corresponds to the nitrile carbon (C#N), consistent with its sp-hybridized nature and strong deshielding. Two aliphatic peaks at ~40 ppm and ~20 ppm represent the methylene group (CH2) linking the thiazole to the main ring and the methyl group (S-CH3) attached to sulfur, respectively. The ~40 ppm signal may also include contributions from the quaternary carbon adjacent to the nitrile in the central ring. The absence of signals above 200 ppm confirms no additional carbonyl or carboxyl groups, while the lack of peaks below 10 ppm excludes terminal methyl groups not attached to heteroatoms. The spectrum’s simplicity (seven peaks vs. 11 carbons) suggests overlapping environments, particularly in the aromatic and heterocyclic regions, likely due to symmetry or similar electronic environments in the thiazole and central ring systems.

These substituents deshield the ortho and para positions, shifting the protons downfield. A smaller peak near 7 ppm may correspond to the ortho protons (H-2 and H-6) on the same ring, which experience slightly different electronic environments due to the substituents.

This splitting pattern suggests coupling with neighboring protons. A broad, low-intensity peak near 10 ppm is indicative of the hydroxyl (-OH) proton, which typically appears as a variable downfield signal due to hydrogen bonding. The amino group (-NH2) protons are not distinctly resolved here, possibly appearing as a broad multiplet in the 3–5 ppm range or undergoing rapid exchange with solvent. The absence of signals above 12 ppm suggests no carboxylic acid or strongly acidic protons are present.

In the aromatic region (120–140 ppm), multiple peaks arise from the trifluoromethylphenyl substituent and the pyridazinone ring. The CF3 group induces strong deshielding, with its attached carbon resonating near ~125 ppm. Additional peaks at ~130–140 ppm correspond to aromatic carbons ortho- and para- to the CF3 group, while signals near ~120 ppm likely represent meta-substituted aromatic carbons. The pyridazinone ring carbons, particularly those adjacent to the nitrogens, appear in the ~130–150 ppm range due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the ring nitrogens and ketone. Two peaks at ~55 ppm are attributed to the methoxy groups: one from the ester (COOCH3) and another from the OCH3 substituent on the pyridazinone ring.

Overall, the spectrum aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the ester, ketone, methoxy substituents, and aromatic systems. The trifluoromethyl group’s influence is evident in the deshielded aromatic carbons, while the heterocyclic ring’s electronic environment dictates the chemical shifts of its constituent carbons. This analysis underscores the utility of C-NMR in elucidating functional groups and substitution patterns in complex heterocycles."

The tert-butyl group typically exhibits upfield 1H shifts (~1 ppm) and 13C shifts ~30 ppm due to its high symmetry and shielding. The cyclohexyl protons and carbons appear as multiple peaks in this region, reflecting conformational heterogeneity and diastereotopic environments. Aromatic protons and carbons are evident in the region 1H: 6.5–8 ppm and 13C: 120–140 ppm. These peaks correlate with the benzene ring (c1ccccc1) and the indole-like heterocycle (c1[nH]c2...). The aromatic system shows characteristic downfield shifts due to deshielding effects from electron-withdrawing groups, such as the sulfone (S(=O)(=O)) and ketone (C(=O)) functionalities. The hydroxyl-bearing carbon (C(O)H) may contribute to a cross-peak near 1H: 4–5 ppm and 13C: 60–80 ppm, though its exact assignment requires further analysis. Notably, the spectrum lacks cross-peaks for quaternary carbons (e.g., the ketone carbon at C(=O) or the sulfone-attached aromatic carbon), as HSQC only detects carbons directly bonded to protons. The absence of peaks in the 13C range >160 ppm confirms this limitation. The methyl group attached to the indole nitrogen (Cc1[nH]...) is likely represented by a cross-peak near 1H: 2–3 ppm and 13C: 10–20 ppm, consistent with typical methyl shifts in electron-rich environments. Overall, the HSQC spectrum provides critical insights into the protonated carbon framework of C24H31NO4S, enabling the mapping of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroatom-adjacent environments. Further analysis with complementary techniques (e.g., HMBC, COSY) would resolve long-range couplings and quaternary carbons to complete the structural assignment."

The spectrum displays two prominent peaks in the high chemical shift region (10–11 ppm), indicative of strongly deshielded proton environments. The most downfield peak (~11 ppm) corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton (O=C(O)H), which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl group and the overall electron-deficient triazole ring system. The second peak (~10.5 ppm) arises from aromatic protons on the substituted phenyl ring. The phenyl group in this molecule is substituted with two chlorine atoms at the 3- and 4-positions, creating a strongly electron-withdrawing environment that deshields the remaining aromatic protons. The three aromatic hydrogens (positions 2, 5, and 6 on the phenyl ring) likely exhibit overlapping chemical shifts due to their proximity to the chlorine substituents and the triazole ring, resulting in a single merged signal. The absence of peaks in the aliphatic region (0–5 ppm) confirms there are no sp³-hybridized carbon-bound protons in the molecule. The integration of the peaks aligns with the molecular formula, where the carboxylic acid contributes one proton and the phenyl ring contributes three. The high chemical shifts and peak splitting patterns are consistent with the structural features of this chlorinated triazole derivative, including the electron-withdrawing trichloromethyl group (C(Cl)₃) and the dichlorophenyl substituent, which collectively enhance the deshielding of all proton environments."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across three primary regions: the carbonyl/aromatic range (160–220 ppm), the aromatic/olefinic range (100–160 ppm), and the aliphatic range (0–100 ppm). The most downfield peak at approximately 170 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ester group, a characteristic feature of electron-withdrawing environments. Adjacent to this, a peak near 160 ppm likely arises from the aromatic carbon bonded to the fluorine atom, as fluorine’s electronegativity deshields nearby carbons. In the aromatic/olefinic region, multiple resonances between 120–140 ppm reflect the substituted benzene rings (from the phenoxy and fluorophenyl groups) and the vinyl group (C=C1CCC1). The fluorinated aromatic ring exhibits splitting patterns due to fluorine-carbon coupling, observable as doublets or multiplets. The phenoxy group’s aromatic carbons appear in the 110–130 ppm range, while the vinyl carbon of the cyclobutene moiety (C=C1) resonates near 105 ppm, consistent with sp² hybridization. The aliphatic region shows peaks at ~50 ppm (quaternary carbon of the cyclopropane ring), 30–40 ppm (methylene carbons in the cyclopropane and cyclobutene rings), and ~20 ppm (methyl groups). The ester’s α-carbon (adjacent to C=O) appears near 60 ppm, influenced by the electron-withdrawing ester oxygen. Notably, the cyano group (C#N) in the ester side chain contributes a sharp peak at ~115 ppm, typical for sp-hybridized carbons. This spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s diverse functional groups: aromatic systems, strained rings, and heteroatom substitutions. The chemical shifts align with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of fluorine, ester, cyano, and cyclic motifs. Integration of peak intensities would further validate the number of equivalent carbons, though the current data already provides strong evidence for the molecular framework."

Additional significant fragments include peaks at m/z 232, 203, 204, and 205, which may arise from further dissociation of the benzodiazepine core or isotopic contributions from chlorine (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl).

The spectrum displays a dominant molecular ion peak at m/z 276, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. This peak is the highest in relative abundance, indicating a stable molecular ion under the ionization conditions. A prominent peak at m/z 248 (276 - 28) suggests a loss of a carbonyl group (CO), likely originating from the ester moiety (CCOC=O). Adjacent to this, a peak at m/z 247 (276 - 29) may correspond to the elimination of a C2H4O fragment, consistent with the ethoxy group in the ester. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 230 (248 - 18), indicative of a subsequent loss of water (H2O), and at m/z 202 (230 - 28), which may arise from further fragmentation of the heterocyclic core. The peak at m/z 185 (202 - 17) could correspond to the loss of ammonia (NH3), a common fragmentation pathway for nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Smaller peaks at m/z 169, 158, and 146 suggest stepwise cleavage of the fused bicyclic structure, potentially involving the pyrazole or quinoline-like rings. The presence of chlorine is evidenced by isotope peaks: for example, the molecular ion at m/z 276 exhibits a minor companion peak at m/z 278 (approximately 32% relative abundance), consistent with the natural isotopic abundance of ³⁷Cl. Similarly, the peak at m/z 248 has a corresponding ³⁷Cl isotope peak at m/z 250. These isotopic patterns confirm the inclusion of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. The fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the compound, including the ester group, chlorinated heterocycle, and aromatic rings. The stability of the molecular ion and the observed fragmentations are characteristic of electron ionization (EI) spectra, where bond cleavages are driven by the molecule's inherent structural weaknesses. This spectrum provides critical insights into the molecular architecture and fragmentation behavior of this chlorinated heterocyclic compound."

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption features consistent with the cyclic urea structure of 1,3-diazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-2-en-4-one. The most prominent peak occurs at approximately 3300 cm⁻¹, corresponding to the N-H stretching vibration of the secondary amine groups. This sharp, moderately intense band is typical for hydrogen-bonded N-H groups in urea derivatives. A strong, sharp absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ is observed, which can be assigned to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the urea moiety. This position is slightly lower than typical ketones (1715–1750 cm⁻¹) due to resonance delocalization of the carbonyl group into the adjacent nitrogen lone pairs. Additional key features include a series of medium-intensity peaks in the 1450–1350 cm⁻¹ region, likely corresponding to C-N stretching and N-H bending vibrations within the bicyclic framework. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex absorption patterns, with notable peaks at ~1250 cm⁻¹ (C-N stretching coupled with ring vibrations) and ~1050 cm⁻¹ (possibly C-C stretching or in-plane ring deformations). The absence of strong absorption above 3600 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of O-H or terminal N-H groups, while the absence of peaks near 2200 cm⁻¹ rules out triple bonds or nitrile groups. The spectral profile aligns well with the proposed structure, where the bicyclic system restricts conformational flexibility, leading to sharp, well-defined peaks. The observed N-H and C=O bands are diagnostic for urea functionalities, and the overall pattern matches literature data for similar cyclic urea derivatives. This IR spectrum provides clear evidence for the presence of both amine and carbonyl groups in a rigid bicyclic framework."

The spectrum displays characteristic proton resonances corresponding to the structural features of the molecule. Key observations include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–10 ppm):** - A prominent singlet at ~11 ppm suggests a deshielded amide proton, likely from the urea moiety (N–H adjacent to the carbonyl group). - Multiple peaks between 7–8 ppm correspond to aromatic protons on the substituted benzene ring (c4ccccc4C(F)(F)F) and the pyridine/pyrazine-like ring (c2ccc(nn2)). The CF3-substituted benzene exhibits slightly downfield-shifted protons due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group. 2. **Aliphatic Region (2–4 ppm):** - A singlet at ~3.5 ppm is consistent with methylene protons (CH2) adjacent to the amide carbonyl (N–CH2–C=O) in the piperazine ring. - A multiplet at ~2.5 ppm likely arises from the isopropyl group’s CH2 protons (CC(C)CCN–CH2–) coupled to neighboring protons. 3. **High-Field Region (<2 ppm):** - A doublet near 1 ppm corresponds to the methyl protons (CH3) of the isopropyl group, split by coupling to the adjacent CH proton. 4. **Integrations and Splitting Patterns:** - The integration ratios align with the molecular symmetry, with the aromatic region showing cumulative intensity for 7 protons (benzene + heteroaromatic ring), the aliphatic region accounting for 8 protons (piperazine and isopropyl CH2 groups), and the methyl group contributing 6 protons (two equivalent CH3 groups). - Splitting patterns (doublets, multiplets) reflect spin-spin coupling between protons in the isopropyl and piperazine moieties. The spectrum confirms the presence of the trifluoromethyl group (no visible 19F coupling in this 1H-NMR), the urea linkage, and the aromatic systems, consistent with the proposed structure.

Additional minor peaks between 1.0–1.5 ppm may correspond to the isopropyl methyl groups (CH₃) as doublets, though their low intensity suggests overlap with baseline noise. The absence of signals above 9 ppm indicates no aldehyde or carboxylic acid protons, aligning with the ester and amide functional groups present. The sulfur-bound amide proton (S-NH-C=O) is likely obscured by the aromatic region or appears as a broad signal near 6–8 ppm, depending on hydrogen bonding. Overall, the spectrum confirms the molecular framework, with key resonances matching the aromatic, benzylic, and aliphatic components of the structure."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C12H23NO3 (SMILES: CC(C)(C)OC(=O)NC1CCC(CCO)C1). The spectrum displays characteristic peaks corresponding to the proton environments in the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)-protected amine and the cyclohexane ring with an ethanol substituent. The most prominent feature is a singlet at approximately 2.0 ppm, which integrates to multiple protons and is attributed to the methylene (CH2) groups on the cyclohexane ring adjacent to the carbamate nitrogen. This region typically appears downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbamate group. A triplet near 3.5–3.7 ppm, with moderate intensity, corresponds to the CH2 protons of the ethanol side chain (-CH2CH2OH) adjacent to the oxygen atom. This splitting pattern arises from coupling with the neighboring CH2 group. A smaller singlet at ~4.5 ppm is consistent with the NH proton of the carbamate, which is deshielded by hydrogen bonding and the adjacent carbonyl group. Additional multiplets between 1.0–2.0 ppm represent the remaining aliphatic protons on the cyclohexane ring and the tert-butyl group of the Boc moiety. The tert-butyl protons typically appear as a singlet near 1.4 ppm, though they may overlap with ring protons in this region. The absence of signals above 5 ppm confirms the lack of aromatic or olefinic protons, aligning with the saturated structure. The spectrum’s baseline noise and peak resolution suggest a well-dissolved sample in a deuterated solvent, likely CDCl3, which is common for Boc-protected amines. Integration ratios and splitting patterns support the structural assignment, with no unexpected impurities or artifacts observed. This H-NMR data provides clear evidence for the Boc-protected cyclohexylamine derivative with an ethanol side chain, as defined by the given molecular formula and SMILES notation."

This peak aligns with the calculated molecular weight of the compound, accounting for the contributions of bromine (Br, 79/81 isotopes) and chlorine (Cl, 35/37 isotopes), which contribute to the observed isotopic pattern. The base peak (100% relative abundance) appears at m/z 245, indicating a highly stable fragment. This fragment likely arises from the loss of the methylsulfonyl group (CH3SO2, 79 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for sulfonamide-containing compounds. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 229 and 230, which may correspond to further fragmentation of the benzotriazole core, potentially involving the loss of hydrogen chloride (HCl) or bromine (Br). Peaks at m/z 165 and 166 suggest cleavage of the triazole ring, retaining the brominated and chlorinated aromatic moiety. Smaller peaks at m/z 130, 150, and 151 likely represent fragments of the heterocyclic structure, with the presence of bromine and chlorine influencing their isotopic distributions. The spectrum demonstrates characteristic fragmentation patterns for halogenated heterocycles, with the sulfonamide group acting as a labile site for initial dissociation.

The ¹H chemical shifts range from approximately 7.5 to 8.5 ppm, while the corresponding ¹³C chemical shifts span ~120–150 ppm, consistent with aromatic environments. These features align with the molecule’s two benzene rings, which dominate the structure. The electron-withdrawing nitro (NO₂) and chloro (Cl) substituents deshield adjacent protons and carbons, shifting their signals downfield (higher ppm values). The sulfoxide group (S=O) further influences the electronic environment of the attached aromatic ring, contributing to the observed chemical shifts. Notably, the HSQC spectrum does not reveal quaternary carbons (non-protonated carbons), such as those bonded to chlorine or the sulfoxide sulfur, as this technique selectively detects proton-carbon pairs.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between 1H and 13C nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the structure. The x-axis represents 1H chemical shifts (ppm), ranging from -2 to 14 ppm, while the y-axis corresponds to 13C chemical shifts (ppm), spanning 0 to 200 ppm. Each cross-peak (black dot) indicates a direct 1H-13C bond connection. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic region (1H: 6–9 ppm; 13C: 100–150 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this area reflect the aromatic protons and carbons of the pyridine, indazole, and chlorophenyl rings. For example, a cluster of peaks near 7.5–8.5 ppm (1H) and 120–140 ppm (13C) corresponds to the conjugated aromatic systems. The presence of a chlorine substituent on the phenyl ring (from the SMILES) likely induces deshielding effects, shifting adjacent protons and carbons downfield. 2. **Aliphatic region (1H: 0.5–3 ppm; 13C: 10–60 ppm):** Peaks in this range arise from the isopropyl group (CC(C)C) and the methylene linker (CH2) in the nnn(CC(C)C) moiety. A distinct cross-peak near 1.2 ppm (1H) and 20 ppm (13C) is consistent with the isopropyl methyl groups, while a peak at ~2.5 ppm (1H) and ~45 ppm (13C) suggests the CH2 group adjacent to the indazole nitrogen. 3. **Methoxy group (1H: ~3.8 ppm; 13C: ~52 ppm):** A well-defined cross-peak at ~3.9 ppm (1H) and ~52 ppm (13C) corresponds to the OCH3 group in the ester (COOCH3) functionality. The electron-withdrawing ester carbonyl deshields the methoxy protons, shifting them downfield relative to typical aliphatic protons. 4. **Carbonyl region (13C: ~165 ppm):** A cross-peak at ~165 ppm (13C) and ~8.5 ppm (1H) likely reflects the ester carbonyl carbon (COOCH3) and its adjacent aromatic proton. The high 13C shift is characteristic of sp2-hybridized carbonyl carbons. The spectrum confirms the presence of all protonated carbons in the structure, with no unexpected peaks, indicating a pure sample. The distribution of cross-peaks aligns with the molecular framework, including the heterocyclic rings, aliphatic side chains, and functional groups.

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C16H16O2 (SMILES: COc1ccc(CCC(=O)c2ccccc2)cc1). The spectrum displays several key peaks that provide insights into the molecular structure and fragmentation behavior of the compound. The molecular ion peak (M⁺) appears at m/z 241, confirming the molecular weight of the compound. The base peak, representing the most abundant fragment, is observed at m/z 121, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. Prominent peaks at m/z 105, 107, 122, 133, and 91 further characterize the fragmentation pattern. The peak at m/z 105 corresponds to the benzoyl cation (C₇H₅O⁺), a common fragment in aromatic ketones formed via alpha-cleavage adjacent to the carbonyl group. This cleavage generates a stabilized acylium ion, explaining its significant abundance. The peak at m/z 91 is characteristic of the tropylium ion (C₇H₇⁺), which arises from the phenyl ring system and is a hallmark of aromatic compounds. The peak at m/z 121 is likely due to a McLafferty rearrangement, a common fragmentation pathway for ketones involving hydrogen transfer and cleavage of the gamma bond, producing a fragment with the carbonyl group and a substituted benzene ring (C₈H₉O⁺). The peak at m/z 133 may result from a loss of a methyl group (CH₃, 15 Da) from the McLafferty fragment (121 + 15 = 136; however, this discrepancy suggests alternative fragmentation pathways, such as additional bond cleavages or rearrangements). The peak at m/z 107 could correspond to a fragment retaining the methoxy group (C₆H₇O₂⁺), though its lower abundance indicates less stability compared to other fragments. The peak at m/z 122 may represent an isotopic contribution (e.g., ¹³C or ¹⁸O) or a minor structural variant. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the structure of a methoxy-substituted aromatic ketone, where the carbonyl group and aromatic rings drive the formation of stable cations. The presence of the molecular ion peak at m/z 241 confirms the molecular formula, while the distribution of fragment ions reflects the compound’s structural motifs, including the methoxy group, alkyl chain, and carbonyl functionality. These features collectively validate the proposed structure and provide a comprehensive understanding of the compound’s behavior under mass spectrometry analysis."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at ~0 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (C[C@H](O)), which is highly shielded due to its aliphatic nature. A cluster of peaks between 50–60 ppm likely arises from the methylene (CH₂) and methine (CH) carbons in the piperidine ring (C[C@H]1CN(Cc2ccccc2)C[C@@H]1), as these carbons are adjacent to the nitrogen atom and experience moderate deshielding. The benzyl group (Cc2ccccc2) contributes to peaks in the 120–130 ppm range, typical for aromatic carbons in a phenyl ring. Notably, the substituted phenyl ring (c1ccc(Cl)c(F)c1) exhibits peaks at ~130–150 ppm, with the higher shifts (e.g., ~150 ppm) likely corresponding to carbons directly bonded to the electronegative chlorine and fluorine substituents. These halogens induce significant deshielding due to their inductive effects. The absence of peaks above 150 ppm suggests no carbonyl or highly conjugated carbons are present, consistent with the molecular structure. The peak at ~60 ppm may correspond to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (C[C@H](O)), as oxygenated aliphatic carbons typically resonate in this region. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected chemical environments of the molecule, including aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroatom-substituted carbons."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C10H12N4S (SMILES: C=CCNc1nc(N)c2scc(C)c2n1). The spectrum displays six distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the carbon environments in the fused thienopyrimidine core, the allyl substituent, and the methyl group. The most downfield peak at ~150 ppm corresponds to the quaternary carbon in the pyrimidine ring adjacent to two nitrogen atoms, a hallmark of electron-deficient aromatic systems. A prominent peak at ~130 ppm arises from the sp²-hybridized carbons in the allyl group (C=CCN) and potentially the thiophene ring carbons adjacent to sulfur. The signal at ~100 ppm is attributed to the carbon bonded to the exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) on the pyrimidine ring, which experiences deshielding due to the electron-donating effect of the amino substituent. A sharp peak at ~50 ppm reflects the methylene carbon (-CH₂-) of the allyl chain directly attached to the pyrimidine nitrogen, where the electronegative nitrogen induces moderate deshielding. The methyl group (-CH₃) on the thiophene ring appears as a peak near ~20 ppm, consistent with its aliphatic character and proximity to the aromatic system. Finally, a minor peak at ~100 ppm may correspond to the thiophene carbon bonded to the methyl group, though its exact assignment could overlap with other aromatic signals. The spectrum’s simplicity relative to the molecular complexity suggests symmetry in the fused ring system or overlapping resonances, which is typical for heterocyclic compounds. These features collectively validate the structural motifs of the thienopyrimidine core, allylamine side chain, and methyl substitution."

A broad, intense peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ is indicative of N–H stretching vibrations, likely arising from the urea moiety (–NC(N)=O) and possibly secondary contributions from amide or carbamate N–H groups. The sharp, strong absorption at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching of the ketone group adjacent to the aromatic ring, while a slightly broader band near 1650 cm⁻¹ may reflect the carbamate (C(=O)O) or amide carbonyl stretching. Additional peaks in the 1500–1600 cm⁻¹ region suggest aromatic C=C stretching vibrations from the chlorophenyl ring. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays multiple complex bands, including C–O stretching from the ether linkage (around 1200–1300 cm⁻¹) and C–Cl stretching (typically 500–600 cm⁻¹), though the latter is less distinct.

The spectrum displays distinct carbon environments across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the structural complexity of the compound. Key features include a prominent peak near 170 ppm, corresponding to the carbonyl carbon of the ester group (COOCH3), which is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent oxygen. A cluster of intense signals between 120–150 ppm arises from aromatic carbons, including those in the chlorinated phenyl ring (c3cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c3) and the substituted pyrazole ring (n2nc...cc2). The presence of two chlorine atoms causes significant downfield shifts for adjacent aromatic carbons due to their electronegativity and inductive effects. A sharp resonance near 100 ppm is attributed to the methoxy carbon (OCH3) of the ester, which appears upfield compared to the carbonyl but remains deshielded relative to aliphatic carbons. Peaks in the 20–50 ppm range correspond to aliphatic carbons, including the piperidine ring (C2CCNCC2) and the methylene linker (CH2) connecting the aromatic system to the heterocycle. These signals exhibit moderate intensity and are consistent with sp³-hybridized carbons in a flexible, non-aromatic framework. The absence of signals below 10 ppm confirms the lack of methyl groups in non-oxygenated environments. The spectrum’s dispersion and peak multiplicity align with the molecular symmetry of the compound. For instance, the two chlorine-substituted aromatic carbons on the phenyl ring likely produce overlapping signals due to their equivalent electronic environments. Similarly, the piperidine ring’s carbons may exhibit broadened peaks due to conformational averaging in solution. No quaternary carbons beyond the ester and aromatic systems are evident, as indicated by the absence of additional high-intensity peaks above 150 ppm. This C-NMR spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule’s carbon framework, corroborating the presence of aromatic, aliphatic, and functionalized carbonyl/methoxy groups as defined by the SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule’s diverse functional groups and structural complexity. The most downfield peaks (160–180 ppm) correspond to carbonyl carbons, including the amide (C=O in the morpholine-2-one ring) and the ester/amide carbonyl groups. These high-frequency signals arise from the deshielding effects of electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Adjacent to these, aromatic carbons (120–150 ppm) are observed, with fluorine substituents on the benzene ring inducing further downfield shifts (via inductive effects) and potential splitting due to C-F coupling. The aromatic region likely includes four distinct peaks, reflecting the symmetric substitution pattern of the difluorophenyl group. In the aliphatic region (20–80 ppm), multiple resonances are evident. The acetal carbons (O-C-O) in the dioxolane ring appear near 100 ppm, while the piperidine ring carbons (CH2 groups) resonate between 20–50 ppm. The morpholine-2-one ring contributes peaks in the 50–70 ppm range, particularly for the CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen and nitrogen. A prominent peak near 0 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups (C(CH3)2) in the dioxolane ring, which are shielded due to their aliphatic nature and lack of electronegative substituents. The spectrum’s intensity variations reflect the number of equivalent carbons in each environment. For example, the methyl groups (two carbons) exhibit higher intensity than single aromatic carbons. The absence of overlapping peaks in key regions suggests minimal symmetry beyond the dioxolane methyl pairs and the difluorophenyl group. Overall, the C-NMR spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of carbonyl, aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic moieties. The chemical shifts and peak multiplicities provide insights into the electronic environment of each carbon, consistent with the SMILES notation’s functional groups and connectivity."

The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances characteristic of a bicyclic structure with a tert-butyl carbamate group and a carboxylic acid substituent. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at δ 1.40 ppm (intensity ~0.7), corresponding to the nine equivalent methyl protons of the tert-butyl group (C(CH₃)₃). This high-field signal reflects the electron-donating nature of the carbamate functionality. A cluster of overlapping multiplets between δ 1.2–2.0 ppm (total intensity ~0.5) arises from the aliphatic protons of the cyclohexane and piperidine rings. These protons exhibit complex splitting due to their non-equivalent environments and coupling with adjacent CH₂ groups. The methylene protons adjacent to the carboxylic acid group (CH₂COOH) appear as a triplet at δ 2.35 ppm (J ≈ 7 Hz), while the N-CH₂ protons in the piperidine ring resonate at δ 3.50 ppm as a broad triplet (J ≈ 6 Hz), reflecting coupling with neighboring protons. A minor singlet at δ 2.80 ppm (intensity ~0.1) likely corresponds to residual solvent (e.g., DMSO-d₆) or trace impurities. The absence of signals above δ 10 ppm indicates that the carboxylic acid proton (COOH) is either exchanged with deuterium during sample preparation or obscured by baseline noise. The overall spectral pattern confirms the presence of a rigid bicyclic framework with restricted conformational flexibility, as evidenced by the well-resolved aliphatic resonances. This H-NMR data aligns with the proposed structure, where the tert-butyl carbamate (Boc) group provides a distinct spectral signature, and the cyclohexane-piperidine fusion generates characteristic aliphatic splitting patterns. The integration ratios and chemical shifts support the molecular formula C16H27NO4, with no unexpected aromatic or olefinic protons detected."

Additional significant peaks include m/z 298, which may arise from the loss of a butyl group (C4H8, 56 Da) from the molecular ion, and m/z 158, likely originating from cleavage of the piperazine ring system. Peaks at m/z 173 and 185 suggest further decomposition of the heterocyclic framework, potentially involving the pyridine ring. The presence of bromine is corroborated by the m/z 238 and 239 peaks, which may reflect isotopic contributions from ⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br, though the characteristic 1:1 isotope ratio is not distinctly resolved here. Smaller peaks at m/z 99 and 212 correspond to minor fragments, possibly involving the Boc moiety or partial ring structures. The overall fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the Boc-protected piperazine and brominated pyridine substituents. This spectrum provides clear evidence for the molecular identity and stability of key structural motifs under mass spectrometric conditions."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak near 150 ppm arises from the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ester group, which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen atoms. Adjacent to this, a cluster of peaks between 120–140 ppm corresponds to the aromatic carbons of the two benzene rings. These shifts are characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbons in substituted aromatic systems, with variations in chemical shift reflecting differences in electronic environments caused by substituents such as the methyl group and ester linkage. A sharp peak at ~60 ppm is attributed to the methylene carbon (CH₂) in the benzyl ester moiety (OCH₂Ph), which experiences moderate deshielding from the adjacent oxygen. The methyl group (CH₃) attached to the aromatic ring appears as a distinct peak near 20 ppm, consistent with typical aliphatic carbon shifts. The absence of peaks below 10 ppm or above 180 ppm confirms the lack of additional aliphatic or highly deshielded carbonyl groups beyond those accounted for. The spectrum’s resolution and peak distribution align with the structural features of the molecule, including the biphenyl core, ester functionality, and methyl substitution. This analysis underscores the utility of C-NMR in identifying carbon connectivity and functional groups in complex organic molecules."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon environments consistent with the structural features of the compound. The most prominent peak at approximately 150 ppm corresponds to the aromatic carbon adjacent to the nitrogen in the pyridine ring, a hallmark of electron-deficient heteroaromatic systems. Additional aromatic carbons in the pyridine ring appear as lower-intensity peaks near 120–130 ppm, reflecting their deshielded environment due to the electronegative nitrogen. A sharp peak around 120 ppm is attributed to the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group, which is strongly deshielded by the three fluorine atoms and coupled to them via scalar interactions. The methylene carbon (CH2) bonded to the oxygen in the OCF3 group resonates at ~70 ppm, typical for aliphatic carbons adjacent to electronegative atoms. Peaks in the 30–40 ppm range correspond to the cyclobutane ring carbons, with the fluorinated carbon (C-F) appearing slightly downfield (~40 ppm) due to the inductive effect of fluorine. The remaining cyclobutane carbons (CH2) are observed at lower shifts (~30 ppm). The absence of peaks above 160 ppm confirms no carbonyl or highly conjugated carbons are present. The spectrum’s simplicity reflects the symmetry of the CF3 group and the rigid cyclobutane ring, which reduces conformational averaging. This analysis aligns with the molecular formula and SMILES, validating the structural assignment."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 190, which corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, confirming the molecular weight of 189 g/mol for the neutral compound. The base peak at m/z 190 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Several significant fragment ions are observed, providing insights into the structural features of the molecule. Key fragment peaks include m/z 175, 174, 146–149, 133, 135, 119, and 107–109. The peak at m/z 175 (175/190, ~15% relative abundance) likely arises from the loss of a methyl group (–CH3, 15 Da) from the molecular ion, consistent with the presence of a methyl substituent on the pyrazole ring in the SMILES structure. The adjacent peak at m/z 174 may correspond to the loss of a hydroxyl radical (–OH, 17 Da) or a rearrangement involving hydrogen migration. Fragmentation of the heterocyclic rings generates several diagnostic ions. The peaks at m/z 146–149 suggest cleavage of the pyridine ring, with the m/z 148 peak potentially representing a tropylium-like ion stabilized by the hydroxyl and pyrazole substituents. The m/z 133 and 135 peaks (separated by 2 Da) may arise from isotopic contributions or alternative fragmentation pathways involving the pyridine-pyrazole linkage. The m/z 119 peak is characteristic of a fragment retaining the pyridine ring with a hydroxyl group and a portion of the pyrazole moiety, while the m/z 107–109 peaks likely correspond to smaller aromatic fragments, such as a hydroxypyridine derivative. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 100 suggests minimal degradation of the core aromatic systems. The presence of nitrogen atoms in the molecule influences fragmentation patterns, with nitrogen-containing fragments (e.g., m/z 119, 133) exhibiting enhanced stability. The oxygen atom contributes to oxygen-retaining fragments (e.g., m/z 174, 175) and potential dehydration pathways. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, as the observed fragments reflect logical bond cleavages and rearrangements of the pyridine and pyrazole rings, methyl and hydroxyl substituents, and the molecular framework defined by the SMILES notation. This analysis confirms the molecular identity and provides evidence for key structural motifs."

A prominent broad peak near 3400 cm⁻¹ suggests N-H stretching, though its reduced intensity may reflect substitution on the pyrrole nitrogen. The sharp, intense peaks at 1300 cm⁻¹ and 1150 cm⁻¹ are diagnostic of the symmetric and asymmetric S=O stretching vibrations of the sulfonyl (-SO₂-) group, which is a key feature of the 4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl substituent. Aromatic C-H stretching vibrations appear as weaker peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹, consistent with the presence of multiple benzene rings. The sharp absorption near 1200 cm⁻¹ likely corresponds to C-F stretching from the 4-fluorophenyl group. Additional bands in the fingerprint region (1500–600 cm⁻¹) reflect complex vibrational modes of the aromatic systems, including C=C ring stretches and bending vibrations. The absence of a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of ketone or carboxylic acid functionality.

The spectrum displays a complex fragmentation pattern characteristic of a heterocyclic compound containing two thiophene rings and a piperidine-derived moiety. The base peak at m/z 205 suggests the formation of a stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the central C-C bond adjacent to the oxygen-bearing carbon, retaining one thiophene ring and part of the piperidine structure. A prominent peak at m/z 204 corresponds to the molecular ion (M⁺) minus a hydrogen atom, consistent with the molecular weight of 359 g/mol (calculated from the formula), though the exact molecular ion is not observed due to rapid fragmentation.

The presence of multiple sulfur atoms is reflected in the isotope patterns, with minor peaks at m/z 206 and 207 (Δm = 2) suggesting contributions from ³⁴S isotopes. The absence of a strong molecular ion peak aligns with the compound’s susceptibility to fragmentation at the oxygen-bearing tertiary carbon and the propargylic position. Overall, the spectrum confirms the molecular formula and highlights the stability of fragments containing sulfur-rich substructures, consistent with the thiophene and thioether functionalities in the SMILES notation."

The most downfield ¹H chemical shifts (12 ppm and 10 ppm) are observed for protons attached to aromatic carbons in the benzoxazole ring. The peak at (12 ppm, 100 ppm) likely corresponds to the proton at the 2-position of the benzoxazole ring, which is directly bonded to the nitrogen and adjacent to the oxygen, causing significant deshielding. The peak at (10 ppm, 120 ppm) may arise from a proton on the benzoxazole ring near the chlorine substituents, which further deshield the aromatic protons through inductive effects. A peak at (6 ppm, 50 ppm) is consistent with the methoxy group (-OCH₃), where the ¹H shift is slightly elevated due to the electron-withdrawing aromatic environment, and the ¹³C shift aligns with typical methoxy carbons. The final peak at (7 ppm, 140 ppm) corresponds to an aromatic proton on the 4-methoxyphenyl ring, with the carbon shift indicating a deshielded aromatic CH group, likely ortho or para to the methoxy substituent. The absence of additional peaks reflects the molecule’s symmetry and the lack of aliphatic protons beyond the methoxy group.

The spectrum reveals key correlations between proton (1H) and directly attached carbon (13C) chemical shifts, providing insights into the molecular structure. Two primary regions of cross-peaks are observed. The first cluster, located at 1H shifts of 7.0–8.5 ppm and 13C shifts of 100–150 ppm, corresponds to aromatic and heteroaromatic CH groups. These peaks are consistent with the pyridine ring (c1nc(C)ccc1) and triazole rings (n1nccn1, n1nnc(-c2ccc(F)cc2)n1) in the structure. The fluorinated phenyl group (-c2ccc(F)cc2) contributes to deshielded aromatic carbons (13C ~130–140 ppm) and protons (1H ~7.5–8.0 ppm), influenced by the electron-withdrawing fluorine atom. A second cluster appears at 1H shifts of 10.5–12.0 ppm and 13C shifts of 150–200 ppm, indicative of highly deshielded protons attached to sp2-hybridized carbons. These likely arise from the amide carbonyl-adjacent CH2 group (Cn1nnc...) and possibly the methyl-substituted pyridine carbon (nc(C)ccc1), where electron-withdrawing effects from neighboring nitrogen atoms or the amide group (C(=O)) induce downfield shifts. The absence of peaks in the aliphatic region (1H < 3 ppm) suggests that the ethyl (CCN) and methyl (nc(C)) groups may exhibit overlapping or less resolved correlations, though the methyl group’s protonated carbon (13C ~15–20 ppm) is not distinctly visible here. The spectrum’s dispersion and chemical shift ranges align with the molecule’s heterocyclic and aromatic complexity, with fluorine’s inductive effects subtly altering nearby carbon and proton environments. No correlations are observed for quaternary carbons (e.g., carbonyl carbons or fluorinated aromatic carbons), as expected in HSQC experiments. This analysis confirms the connectivity of protonated carbons within the molecule’s fused heteroaromatic and fluorinated aromatic frameworks."

A broad, intense band centered near 3000 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the O-H stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group, indicative of strong hydrogen bonding. Sharp peaks near 3000 cm⁻¹ correspond to aromatic C-H stretching vibrations, consistent with the benzene and pyridone rings in the structure. A prominent, sharp peak at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ arises from the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid, while a slightly weaker peak near 1650 cm⁻¹ is likely due to the ketone carbonyl in the pyridone ring. Additional peaks in the 1600–1400 cm⁻¹ region reflect C=C stretching vibrations in the aromatic systems. The presence of fluorine is supported by a distinct absorption near 1200–1000 cm⁻¹, corresponding to the C-F stretching mode. The fingerprint region below 1000 cm⁻¹ contains multiple peaks from C-H out-of-plane bending vibrations in the aromatic rings and C-N stretching vibrations from the pyridone moiety.

Aromatic protons appear in the 7.8–6.8 ppm range, with a singlet at ~7.8 ppm likely representing the proton on the imidazole ring (c2 position) and multiplets at ~7.5–7.2 ppm arising from the trifluoromethylphenyl group. The singlet at ~6.8 ppm corresponds to the aromatic proton on the chlorinated imidazole ring (n2 position), deshielded by the adjacent chlorine atom. Aliphatic regions show a triplet at ~4.2 ppm (J = 7.2 Hz) for the CH2 group adjacent to the quinazolinedione core (n-CCCC), while a multiplet at ~3.8 ppm integrates to the CH2 protons of the propyl linker (CCCc2).

This downfield shift is characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons in conjugated systems. Adjacent to this, a cluster of peaks between 120–140 ppm arises from aromatic carbons in the indole and pyridone rings, which experience deshielding due to electron-withdrawing effects and ring current interactions. A sharp peak at ~60 ppm is attributed to the methylene carbon (CH₂) of the cyclopropylmethoxy group (OCH₂-cyclopropyl), where the oxygen atom induces moderate deshielding.

Another aromatic carbon in the furan ring appears around 100 ppm, consistent with typical heteroaromatic systems. The sulfinyl group (S=O) introduces anisotropy, causing the adjacent methylene carbon (S-CH2) to resonate at ~50–70 ppm, observed here as a peak near 70 ppm. The isobutyl chain (CC(C)C) contributes multiple peaks: the methine carbon (CH) linked to sulfur appears at ~40–50 ppm (~50 ppm in the spectrum), while the two methyl groups (CH3) in the isobutyl moiety are observed at ~20 ppm and ~10 ppm, reflecting their distinct environments.

A prominent sharp peak at approximately 3500 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the O–H stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group attached to the pyridine ring. This absorption is consistent with a free or weakly hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl moiety, as broadening typically associated with strong hydrogen bonding is absent. In the region between 3000–3100 cm⁻¹, multiple medium-intensity peaks are observed, attributable to aromatic C–H stretching vibrations from both the pyridine and benzene rings. These peaks align with the expected unsaturated C–H stretching frequencies in heteroaromatic and aromatic systems. A strong, well-defined absorption near 1200 cm⁻¹ is indicative of C–O stretching vibrations, likely arising from the ether linkage (–OCH2–) connecting the pyridine and benzene rings. This region is also consistent with contributions from C–N stretching vibrations in the pyridine ring, though the ether C–O stretch dominates due to its higher polarity. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays a complex pattern of peaks. Notably, a distinct absorption near 550 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C–Br stretching vibration, confirming the presence of the bromine substituent on the pyridine ring. Additional peaks between 700–900 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of out-of-plane C–H bending vibrations in the aromatic rings, with the benzene ring’s monosubstitution pattern likely contributing to the splitting observed in this region. The absence of significant absorptions near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of carbonyl (C=O) functionality, consistent with the molecular formula and SMILES notation. Overall, the spectral features align with the proposed structure, highlighting the hydroxyl, ether, aromatic, and bromine-containing moieties. This analysis underscores the utility of IR spectroscopy in identifying functional groups and validating structural assignments in heteroaromatic systems."

A broad, partially resolved peak near ~4.8 ppm is attributed to the hydroxyl proton ([C@H](O) group), which appears broad due to hydrogen bonding and exchange effects. A triplet at ~3.8 ppm (integration ~2H) and a quartet at ~4.2 ppm (integration ~2H) are assigned to the methylene protons adjacent to the oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the pyrrolidine ring, respectively. These signals reflect the deshielding effects of the electronegative atoms and coupling with neighboring protons. Additional multiplets in the 1.5–2.5 ppm region correspond to the remaining aliphatic protons in the ring, which exhibit complex splitting due to their stereochemical environment. The absence of aromatic signals confirms the lack of unsaturated rings, while the small peaks near ~7.2–7.3 ppm likely represent residual solvent (e.g., chloroform-d). The trifluoroacetyl group (CF3) does not produce direct H-NMR signals but influences the chemical shifts of nearby protons through its strong electron-withdrawing effect. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected proton environments of the molecule, including the ester, hydroxyl, pyrrolidine ring, and trifluoroacetyl substituents."

The spectrum displays distinct features characteristic of aromatic and aliphatic protons in the molecule. A prominent singlet at ~11 ppm suggests the presence of an amide proton (NH) in the piperazinone ring, deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl group. The aromatic region (6–9 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks, including a high-intensity signal at ~8.5 ppm and overlapping multiplets between 7.5–8 ppm, corresponding to protons on the chlorophenyl and quinazoline rings. These shifts reflect the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine substituent and the nitrogen-rich heterocyclic framework. A sharp singlet at ~4 ppm integrates to four protons, assignable to the two equivalent methylene (CH2) groups in the piperazinone ring, which are deshielded by proximity to both the carbonyl and nitrogen atoms. The absence of coupling in this signal implies symmetry or rapid conformational averaging in the ring. The spectrum lacks signals below 3 ppm, consistent with the absence of aliphatic protons outside the piperazinone moiety. Overall, the chemical shifts and splitting patterns align with the proposed structure, highlighting the electronic influence of the heterocyclic core and substituents on proton environments."

The spectrum displays several key features characteristic of its molecular structure and fragmentation pattern. The molecular ion peak at m/z 406 corresponds to the intact molecule, confirming the molecular weight. The base peak at m/z 294, the most intense signal, suggests a highly stable fragment formed via cleavage of the aromatic ether linkage, likely resulting from the loss of a C6H4Cl group (phenylchloride) from the parent structure. This fragmentation pathway is energetically favorable due to the stability of the resulting cationic fragment. Additional prominent peaks include m/z 259 and 258, which likely arise from further fragmentation of the m/z 294 ion, possibly via loss of HCl or other small neutral species. The presence of chlorine isotopes (35Cl and 37Cl) is evident in the characteristic 3:1 intensity ratios observed for peaks such as m/z 157/158 (Cl-containing fragment) and m/z 295/296 (isotopic contribution to the base peak). Peaks at m/z 337 and 311 may correspond to fragments retaining portions of the oxazole ring (c3ccno3) or amide linkage, while m/z 388 could reflect the loss of water (H2O) from the molecular ion. The spectrum also shows minor peaks at m/z 158 and 159, consistent with a fragment containing a single chlorine atom, and m/z 247/248, which may originate from cleavage of the nitrile (CN) group or adjacent bonds. The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the molecule’s structural features, including its dichlorinated aromatic rings, oxazole moiety, and amide bond, providing insights into its decomposition under mass spectrometric conditions. These data collectively support the assigned molecular formula and structural connectivity."

The most downfield 1H chemical shift (~10 ppm) is paired with a 13C shift near 100 ppm, likely arising from a protonated aromatic carbon in the phenyl ring, deshielded by the electron-withdrawing tert-butyl group or conjugation effects. A peak at ~7 ppm (1H) and ~50 ppm (13C) suggests a methylene (CH2) group adjacent to an electronegative atom, such as the ester-linked OCH2 in the ethyl substituent. Two cross-peaks near ~2.5 ppm (1H) with 13C shifts at ~30 ppm and ~50 ppm correspond to aliphatic CH2 and CH3 groups in the ethyl side chains (both the thiophene-attached -CH2CH3 and ester -OCH2CH3), with the higher 13C shift possibly reflecting the carbonyl-adjacent OCH2. The upfield peak at ~1.5 ppm (1H) and ~20 ppm (13C) aligns with the tert-butyl methyl groups (C(CH3)3), which typically exhibit shielded 13C resonances.

The spectrum displays four distinct cross-peaks, indicating correlations between proton (1H) and directly bonded carbon (13C) nuclei. The most downfield 1H chemical shift (~11 ppm) correlates with a 13C resonance near 155 ppm, characteristic of the NH proton in the pyridone ring (n[nH]c1=O) and its adjacent carbonyl carbon. This deshielded region is consistent with hydrogen bonding or resonance effects from the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. Three additional cross-peaks are observed in the aromatic region. A peak at ~7.8 ppm (1H) and ~120 ppm (13C) corresponds to a proton on an aromatic ring substituted with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl or CF3), which deshields the carbon. Another peak at ~7.5 ppm (1H) and ~110 ppm (13C) likely arises from a proton on a less substituted aromatic position, while a third at ~8.2 ppm (1H) and ~130 ppm (13C) suggests a proton adjacent to a heteroatom (e.g., oxygen in the ether linkage) or near the cyano group (C#N). The absence of peaks in the aliphatic region (0–4 ppm) aligns with the lack of non-aromatic protons in the structure, except for the CF2 group, whose protons may exhibit broadened signals due to fluorine coupling. The spectrum confirms the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic motifs in the molecule, with chemical shifts reflecting the influence of substituents like Cl, CF3, and C#N.

The spectrum displays several prominent peaks across the m/z range, with the molecular ion peak (M⁺) observed at m/z 266, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the compound. The base peak (highest relative abundance) appears at m/z 105, indicating a highly stable fragment. Other significant peaks are detected at m/z 132, 149, 164, 191, and 207, along with secondary peaks at 89, 117, 133, 150, and 234. The molecular ion peak (m/z 266) confirms the molecular formula, while the base peak at m/z 105 suggests a fragment arising from cleavage of the ester (COOCH₃) and thiocyanate (N=C=S) groups, likely retaining a portion of the aromatic ring.

Peaks at m/z 132 and 149 likely originate from further fragmentation of the aromatic ring system, with m/z 132 representing a tropylium-like ion stabilized by the electron-withdrawing ester groups. The peak at m/z 149 could correspond to a fragment retaining one ester group and the thiocyanate moiety. The presence of peaks at m/z 207 and 234 suggests partial retention of the molecular framework, possibly involving rearrangements or loss of smaller neutral species like CO₂ (44 Da) or H₂S (34 Da). The spectrum reflects the compound’s structural features, including the aromatic ring, two ester groups, and thiocyanate substituent, which influence fragmentation pathways. The observed peaks align with expected cleavages of labile bonds (e.g., ester C–O, thiocyanate C–S) and stabilization of charged fragments through resonance or inductive effects. This analysis underscores the utility of mass spectrometry in elucidating molecular architecture and fragmentation behavior for aromatic systems with multiple functional groups."

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to key functional groups in the molecule. A broad, moderately intense peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ is attributed to N–H stretching vibrations of the amide group, indicating hydrogen bonding. Sharp, intense peaks at 1650 cm⁻¹ and 1540 cm⁻¹ correspond to the C=O stretching and N–H bending vibrations of the amide moiety, respectively. The sulfone group (S(=O)₂) is evident through two strong absorption bands at 1320 cm⁻¹ (asymmetric S=O stretch) and 1150 cm⁻¹ (symmetric S=O stretch), both of which are highly diagnostic. The trifluoromethyl (CF₃) group contributes to a series of sharp peaks between 1100–1250 cm⁻¹, reflecting C–F stretching vibrations. Aromatic C–H stretching vibrations appear as weak peaks near 3050–3100 cm⁻¹, consistent with the substituted pyrimidine and phenyl rings. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) contains complex overlapping bands from C–C, C–N, and C–S stretches, as well as ring deformations.

The spectrum displays multiple distinct peaks in the chemical shift range of 0–100 ppm, consistent with the aliphatic nature of the molecule. The most prominent peaks appear at approximately 60 ppm, 55 ppm, 45 ppm, and 30 ppm, with additional smaller peaks distributed across the spectrum. The peak near 60 ppm corresponds to the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group (-OH) on the cyclohexane ring. This downfield shift (higher ppm) arises from the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen atom, deshielding the adjacent carbon. Peaks in the 50–55 ppm range likely represent carbons bonded to nitrogen atoms in the piperidine ring (CC1CCCCN1) and the tertiary amine (N-CH3 group). Nitrogen’s electronegativity similarly deshields these carbons, shifting their signals downfield compared to purely aliphatic carbons. The cluster of peaks between 20–40 ppm corresponds to the remaining aliphatic carbons in the cyclohexane and piperidine rings, as well as the methyl group attached to the amine (N-CH3). These carbons experience relatively shielded environments due to their saturated, non-electronegative substituents. Notably, the absence of peaks above 100 ppm confirms the lack of sp²-hybridized carbons (e.g., aromatic or carbonyl groups), aligning with the molecule’s fully saturated structure. The spectrum’s resolution and peak distribution reflect the molecule’s stereochemistry, with distinct signals for non-equivalent carbons in the chiral cyclohexane ring ([C@@H]1CC[C@@H](O)CC1). This includes diastereotopic carbons influenced by the hydroxyl group’s orientation. The integration of peak intensities would further correlate with the number of carbons in each unique environment, though relative intensities here suggest a typical distribution for a molecule of this size. Overall, the C-NMR spectrum provides clear evidence of the molecule’s aliphatic framework, functional groups (alcohol and amines), and structural complexity, as dictated by its molecular formula and stereochemistry."

A prominent peak at ~170 ppm is consistent with the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ester group, which typically resonates in this downfield region due to the deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen. Adjacent to this, a peak near ~50–60 ppm arises from the methylene carbon (CH2) directly bonded to the ester oxygen (O-CH2), reflecting moderate deshielding. The aromatic region (120–140 ppm) contains multiple peaks, assignable to the six chemically distinct carbons of the benzyl group (Cc1ccccc1), which exhibit characteristic shifts for sp²-hybridized aromatic carbons. A peak at ~20 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (CH3) of the ester, which appears upfield due to its saturated, shielded environment. The benzyl CH2 group (attached to the nitrogen) resonates near ~45–50 ppm, influenced by the adjacent aromatic ring and nitrogen atom.

This downfield shift is characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbons in electron-withdrawing environments. Additional strong signals in the 100–160 ppm region correspond to aromatic carbons from the benzamide, pyridine, and pyrimidine rings. These peaks exhibit varying intensities due to differences in carbon environments and coupling patterns. Notably, the pyridine ring (c4cc(C5CC5)ccn4) and pyrimidine ring (c2ncc...cn2) contribute to the multiplicity of peaks in this region, with deshielding effects from nitrogen atoms causing shifts above 120 ppm.

The peak at m/z 398 corresponds to a loss of 56 Da from the molecular ion, likely due to the elimination of a butyl group (C4H8), which may originate from the branched alkyl chain (CC[C@@H](C)N–) attached to the pyrimidine ring. Fragment ions at m/z 217, 218, and 233 are consistent with the retention of the sulfonamide (–SO2NH–) and pyrimidine core.

Key features include a prominent singlet near 11 ppm, likely attributable to the secondary amine proton (NH) in the -CH2NH- linkage, which is deshielded due to hydrogen bonding or adjacent electronegative groups. Aromatic protons dominate the region between 6–9 ppm. The multiplet at ~8.5 ppm and doublet at ~7.5 ppm correspond to protons on the trifluoromethyl-substituted benzene ring, where the strong electron-withdrawing -CF3 groups deshield ortho and para protons, splitting their signals. The complex multiplet near 7 ppm integrates to protons on the second aromatic ring (bearing the 1,3-dioxolane group), with coupling patterns reflecting meta- and para-substitution. A triplet at ~6.5 ppm and a broad singlet at ~6 ppm are assigned to the dioxolane ring’s methylene protons (-CH2OCH2O-), which exhibit coupling due to their cyclic arrangement. The absence of signals below 5 ppm confirms no aliphatic protons outside the dioxolane and -CH2NH- groups. Integration ratios and splitting patterns align with the proposed structure, validating the presence of 15 non-exchangeable protons distributed across aromatic, amine, and cyclic ether environments."

The spectrum displays correlations between 1H and 13C nuclei, revealing key structural features. The 1H dimension (x-axis) spans ~14 to -2 ppm, while the 13C dimension (y-axis) ranges from ~200 to 0 ppm. Notable peaks include: (1) a cluster of signals near 11–12 ppm (1H) and 170–180 ppm (13C), indicative of the amide proton and its directly bonded carbonyl carbon; (2) aromatic region signals at ~6–8 ppm (1H) and ~125–140 ppm (13C), corresponding to the benzene ring protons and their attached carbons; and (3) aliphatic signals at ~4–5 ppm (1H) and ~50–60 ppm (13C), likely from the CH2 groups adjacent to the sulfonyl (SO2) moiety. The HSQC cross-peaks confirm direct 1H-13C couplings, with the amide proton (11–12 ppm) correlating to the carbonyl carbon (~175 ppm), aromatic protons (6–8 ppm) correlating to aromatic carbons (125–140 ppm), and sulfonyl-adjacent CH2 protons (~4.5 ppm) correlating to their respective carbons (~55 ppm). The absence of quaternary carbon signals in the HSQC is expected, as these lack directly bonded protons. The sulfonyl group’s electron-withdrawing effect likely contributes to the downfield shifts of nearby protons and carbons, while the amide proton’s high chemical shift reflects hydrogen bonding and deshielding. This spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule’s connectivity, confirming the presence of aromatic, amide, and sulfonyl-functionalized aliphatic regions."

Notably, the spectrum lacks correlations in the aromatic region (¹H 6–8 ppm, ¹³C 100–150 ppm), consistent with the absence of sp²-hybridized carbons directly bonded to protons in the imidazole ring, likely due to bromine substitution and carboxylic acid deshielding effects. The observed peaks correspond to aliphatic regions of the molecule. The tert-butyl group (Boc) contributes a singlet near 1.4 ppm (¹H) with a corresponding carbon signal at ~28 ppm, though this may overlap with baseline noise. The piperazine ring’s methylene groups (CH₂) appear as multiplets in the 2.5–4.0 ppm range, correlating with carbons at 45–60 ppm, reflecting their proximity to nitrogen atoms. The downfield ¹³C shifts (60–70 ppm) suggest carbons adjacent to electronegative atoms (e.g., N or O), consistent with the Boc-protected amine and imidazole-linked carbons. The bromine substituent on the imidazole ring likely causes significant deshielding of nearby protons, though their absence in the spectrum may indicate rapid relaxation or exchange broadening. Similarly, the carboxylic acid proton (expected ~10–12 ppm) is not observed, possibly due to solvent exchange or spectral suppression. Overall, the HSQC data align with the proposed structure, highlighting aliphatic CH₂ environments and confirming the connectivity of the piperazine and Boc-protected moieties."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C18H15NO5 (SMILES: COC(=O)C(CN1C(=O)c2cc3ccccc3cc2C1=O)C(C)=O). The spectrum exhibits a prominent base peak at m/z 210, which corresponds to the most abundant fragment ion. Adjacent to this, a peak at m/z 212 (approximately 50% relative abundance) suggests the presence of an isotopic variant, likely due to the natural abundance of ¹³C or ¹⁵N in the fragment. The molecular ion [M+H]⁺ appears at m/z 326, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 325.32 g/mol for C18H15NO5, though it is not the dominant feature. Key fragment ions include m/z 224 (moderate abundance), which may arise from the loss of a small neutral molecule (e.g., CO or H₂O) from a larger intermediate. Peaks at m/z 180 and 181 likely represent fragments retaining the phthalimide core (C₈H₄NO₂, 158 Da) with additional functional groups or rearrangements. The cluster of peaks between m/z 200–236 (e.g., 206, 210, 212, 224) suggests structural instability in the phthalimide or central carbon framework, leading to multiple cleavage pathways. Notably, the peak at m/z 266 may correspond to the loss of acetic acid (CH₃COOH, 60 Da) from the molecular ion, while m/z 257 could result from further fragmentation of this intermediate. Peaks at m/z 284 and 283 might reflect the loss of methoxycarbonyl (CO₂Me, 74 Da) or other neutral species. The presence of multiple low-abundance peaks in the 150–180 m/z range indicates further breakdown of the phthalimide ring or side-chain groups. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule: the phthalimide ring’s electron-withdrawing nature likely promotes cleavage at the central carbon, while the ester and ketone groups contribute to diverse neutral losses. The absence of a dominant molecular ion peak suggests significant in-source fragmentation, typical for compounds with labile functional groups under electron ionization or electrospray conditions. This analysis underscores the utility of mass spectrometry in probing structural motifs and decomposition pathways in complex organic molecules."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 312, corresponding to the intact protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 311 g/mol for C18H21N3S. This peak confirms the presence of the full molecular structure, including the thiophene (c1ccsc1), pyridine (c2cncc...c2), and bridged bicyclic amine (N3CC4CC5CC3CN(C5)C4) moieties. Several fragment ions are observed at lower m/z values, providing insights into structural cleavage patterns. A peak at m/z 162 likely arises from cleavage of the bond between the pyridine and bicyclic amine groups, yielding a fragment containing the thiophene-pyridine substructure (C9H8NS). Additional fragments at m/z 151 and 146 suggest further decomposition of the amine-containing portion, potentially involving loss of alkyl or heteroatom groups from the bicyclic system. The peak at m/z 137 may correspond to a pyridine-thiophene fragment retaining a nitrogen-containing side chain, while m/z 122 could indicate a smaller aromatic fragment, such as a pyridine derivative. The relative abundance of the molecular ion peak compared to fragments suggests moderate stability of the parent structure under the ionization conditions, typical for electrospray ionization (ESI) or similar soft ionization techniques. The absence of significant isotopic peaks (e.g., for sulfur-34) is consistent with the low natural abundance of heavier isotopes in this molecule. These spectral features collectively validate the molecular formula and structural motifs inferred from the SMILES notation, offering a clear fingerprint for identification and structural analysis."

The spectrum displays distinct proton environments characteristic of a complex heterocyclic structure with aromatic, aliphatic, and functional group contributions. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–9 ppm):** Multiple peaks in this range correspond to protons on the pyridine (c4ccccn4) and benzene (c3ccc(-c4ccccn4)cc3) rings. The multiplet at ~7.5–8.5 ppm reflects the deshielded aromatic protons, split by neighboring heteroatoms and substituents. The pyridine ring’s nitrogen induces downfield shifts, while the benzene ring’s substitution pattern (para-linked to pyridine) creates distinct splitting patterns. 2. **Aliphatic Region (1–3 ppm):** A prominent singlet at ~2 ppm dominates this region, likely arising from the isopropyl group’s (C(C)C) equivalent methyl protons. The absence of splitting suggests no adjacent protons, consistent with its attachment to a quaternary carbon or heteroatom. 3. **Functional Group Protons (10–12 ppm):** Sharp peaks near 10–12 ppm indicate exchangeable protons, such as NH or OH groups. These likely correspond to the secondary amine (NC[C@@H](O)CO) and hydroxyl groups in the diol moiety, which are highly sensitive to hydrogen bonding and solvent effects. 4. **Intermediate Region (3–6 ppm):** Peaks here may represent the diol’s CH2 protons (NC[C@@H](O)CO) and the methylene linker (NCc3ccc...) adjacent to the benzene ring. The splitting patterns and chemical shifts suggest coupling with nearby protons and deshielding by electronegative atoms (e.g., oxygen or nitrogen). The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s polycyclic architecture, with distinct electronic environments shaped by conjugation, hydrogen bonding, and steric effects. The integration ratios (not shown) would further clarify proton counts, but the observed peaks align with the SMILES-derived structure, confirming the presence of aromatic heterocycles, aliphatic side chains, and polar functional groups. This H-NMR data provides critical insights into the molecule’s conformational and electronic properties, essential for structural validation and functional analysis."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 329, corresponding to the intact molecule, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 328.8 g/mol. The base peak at m/z 329 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Notable fragment peaks are observed at m/z 293, 273, 266, 225, 226, 194, and 25, which provide insights into the structural features of the compound. The peak at m/z 293 (36 Da less than the molecular ion) suggests the loss of hydrogen chloride (HCl), a common fragmentation pathway for chlorinated compounds. This is supported by the presence of chlorine’s characteristic isotope pattern (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl), though the isotope peak at m/z 295 is not distinctly visible here. The fragment at m/z 273 (56 Da loss) may arise from the cleavage of the allyl group (C₃H₅, 41 Da) combined with additional rearrangements, though further analysis would be needed to confirm this. The peak at m/z 266 (63 Da loss) could correspond to the elimination of a C₄H₇N fragment, potentially involving the pyrazole ring (N-N containing heterocycle) and adjacent substituents. The adjacent peaks at m/z 225 and 226 may represent isotope contributions or structural isomers, with the former likely retaining the chlorine atom (³⁵Cl contributes to m/z 225, while ³⁷Cl would yield m/z 227, though the latter is not prominent here). The fragment at m/z 194 (135 Da loss) suggests a stable substructure, possibly the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine core (C₈H₅ClN₄) with partial retention of the aromatic system. The low-abundance peak at m/z 25 corresponds to a small hydrocarbon fragment (e.g., C₂H₅⁺), typical of alkyl chain cleavage. Overall, the fragmentation pattern supports the assigned structure, with key cleavages involving the allyl group, ether linkage (OCH₂CH₃), and the heterocyclic core.

A second singlet at ~7.8 ppm is attributed to the aromatic protons of the benzyl group (Ph-CH2-), though their exact chemical shift suggests slight deshielding due to conjugation with the hydrazone moiety. The multiplet at ~7.3 ppm integrates to five protons, confirming the presence of a monosubstituted benzene ring. A triplet at ~4.3 ppm (2H) corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) of the ethyl ester, which is deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom.

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of carbon atoms in this bicyclic structure. The most prominent feature is a sharp, high-intensity peak at ~50 ppm, characteristic of aliphatic carbons adjacent to nitrogen atoms, likely corresponding to the methylene (CH₂) groups in the tetrahydropyridine (piperidine-like) ring. This region is consistent with carbons bonded to electronegative nitrogen, which deshields the nuclei and shifts their resonance downfield. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed. A medium-intensity peak at ~120 ppm and two overlapping signals near 130–140 ppm suggest the presence of sp²-hybridized carbons in the pyridine ring. The pyridine moiety typically exhibits carbons in this range, with shifts influenced by the ring’s nitrogen atom and substitution pattern. The quaternary carbon directly bonded to nitrogen in the pyridine ring may contribute to the higher-shift signal (~140 ppm), while the remaining aromatic carbons (e.g., meta/para to nitrogen) resonate at slightly lower fields (~120–130 ppm). A small peak at ~25–30 ppm is also visible, likely arising from less deshielded aliphatic CH₂ groups further from the nitrogen atom in the saturated ring. This region is typical for carbons in a non-conjugated, saturated environment. The absence of signals above 160 ppm indicates no carbonyl or highly electron-deficient carbons, consistent with the molecule’s purely hydrocarbon and amine composition. The spectrum’s peak distribution aligns with the structural features of the SMILES notation: a pyridine ring fused to a partially saturated six-membered ring containing a secondary amine. The observed chemical shifts confirm the presence of both aromatic and aliphatic domains, while the integration and splitting patterns (implied by peak heights) suggest symmetry in certain regions of the molecule. This C-NMR data provides critical insights into the electronic and structural environment of each carbon, supporting the assigned molecular framework."

This high-field signal reflects the electron-donating nature of the tert-butyl moiety and its shielding effect. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.0 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, indicating the presence of a substituted benzene ring. The chlorinated aromatic protons appear as complex multiplets between 7.0–7.8 ppm, with integration patterns suggesting a 1,2,4-disubstitution pattern. The downfield shift of these signals is consistent with the electron-withdrawing effects of both the chlorine atom and the adjacent carbonyl group. A distinct singlet at ~7.9 ppm likely corresponds to the proton ortho to the chlorine substituent, which experiences strong deshielding.

A minor peak at ~8.5 ppm may represent an amide proton, though its low intensity suggests partial exchange with residual solvent or deuterium. The absence of signals below 1.0 ppm confirms the lack of methyl or methylene groups outside the Boc and piperazine/ethylene oxide frameworks.

In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, including a prominent signal near 145 ppm and others around 125–130 ppm. These correspond to the six aromatic carbons of the para-substituted benzene ring, where the electron-withdrawing effects of the octyl chain and the cyclopentyl substituent create distinct chemical environments.

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H15N3O4S (SMILES: C/C=C(/C(=O)O)c1nsc(NC(=O)OC(C)(C)C)n1). The spectrum displays three distinct cross-peaks, correlating proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts for directly bonded pairs. The most downfield peak appears at approximately 10 ppm (¹H) and 175 ppm (¹³C), indicative of a proton attached to a carbon in a highly deshielded environment. This is consistent with the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the molecule, where the adjacent carbon (α-carbon to the carbonyl) experiences strong deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. The second peak at ~7 ppm (¹H) and ~120 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to a vinylic proton and its attached carbon in the C=C double bond (C/C=C/), typical of alkenes with moderate deshielding. The third peak at ~1.5 ppm (¹H) and ~25 ppm (¹³C) reflects the methyl groups (C(CH₃)₃) of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group, which exhibit upfield shifts due to their aliphatic nature and shielding from the surrounding electron density. The absence of additional peaks aligns with the molecular symmetry of the tert-butyl group (three equivalent methyls) and the lack of other protonated carbons in the thiazole ring or Boc moiety. This HSQC data supports the proposed structure by confirming the connectivity of key functional groups, including the carboxylic acid, alkene, and Boc-protected amine, while highlighting the electronic effects of heteroatoms (S, N, O) on chemical shifts."

The spectrum displays correlations between proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts, revealing key structural features. In the aromatic region (¹H 7–8 ppm, ¹³C 120–140 ppm), multiple cross-peaks correspond to the two benzene rings in the molecule. The fluorine substituent on the benzamide ring (position 4 of the terminal phenyl group) induces a downfield shift in adjacent protons and carbons due to its electronegativity, evident in the slightly elevated ¹³C shifts (~130–140 ppm) for aromatic carbons ortho to the fluorine. The oxazole ring (positions 3–5 of the central aromatic system) contributes distinct peaks, with the C2 carbon of the oxazole appearing near 160 ppm, a typical range for heteroaromatic carbons bonded to oxygen and nitrogen. The aliphatic region (¹H 1–4 ppm, ¹³C 20–60 ppm) shows correlations for the piperidine ring (C4–C6 of the piperidine moiety) and the isopropyl ester group. The piperidine protons appear as multiplets in the 1.5–3.5 ppm range, with corresponding carbons spanning 25–55 ppm, reflecting the ring’s conformational flexibility. The isopropyl methyl groups (from the carbamate ester) produce peaks near 1.2 ppm (¹H) and 20–25 ppm (¹³C), consistent with their shielding in a branched alkyl environment. The amide methyl group (N–CH3) is observed near 2.8 ppm (¹H) and 35 ppm (¹³C), characteristic of a methyl group attached to a nitrogen atom. Notably, the spectrum lacks correlations for quaternary carbons (e.g., the oxazole C5 or carbonyl carbons), as HSQC only detects proton-bearing carbons. The absence of signals below 100 ppm in the ¹³C dimension confirms the lack of sp³-hybridized carbons beyond the aliphatic regions described. Overall, the HSQC data aligns with the proposed structure, validating the connectivity of aromatic and aliphatic fragments in the molecule."

    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C19H27NO4 (SMILES: CCOC(=O)C1CCN(C(=O)OC(C)(C)C)CC1c1ccccc1). The spectrum exhibits several key features characteristic of its functional groups. A prominent sharp peak at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the symmetric stretching vibration of the two carbonyl (C=O) groups: one from the ethyl ester moiety and the other from the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) carbamate group. The Boc carbonyl typically absorbs slightly higher (1700–1750 cm⁻¹) than the ethyl ester carbonyl (1735–1750 cm⁻¹), though overlapping may result in a single broadened band. Adjacent to this, a weaker band near 1250 cm⁻¹ arises from C–O stretching vibrations in the ester and Boc groups. Aromatic C=C stretching vibrations from the benzene ring (c1ccccc1) are evident as multiple sharp peaks between 1450–1600 cm⁻¹, consistent with substituted aromatic systems. The C–H stretching region (2800–3000 cm⁻¹) shows multiple weak-to-medium absorptions, corresponding to aliphatic C–H bonds in the ethyl, tert-butyl, and piperidine ring substituents. Notably, the absence of broad N–H or O–H stretching bands (typically 3200–3600 cm⁻¹) aligns with the molecule’s structure, which lacks free hydroxyl or secondary amine groups. The Boc-protected nitrogen is tertiary, eliminating N–H contributions. The fingerprint region (<1000 cm⁻¹) contains complex vibrations, including C–C and C–O bending modes, though specific assignments are less definitive. This spectrum reflects the compound’s hybrid ester-carbamate-aromatic architecture, with diagnostic peaks confirming the presence of carbonyl and aromatic functionalities."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule's structural complexity. Key features include: 1. **Carbonyl and carboxyl carbons (160–180 ppm):** The most intense peak at ~175 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid carbon (C=O) in the side chain, while the peak at ~170 ppm likely arises from the amide carbonyl group in the β-lactam ring. These high-field shifts are characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons. 2. **Aromatic and alkene carbons (120–150 ppm):** Multiple peaks in this region reflect the benzene ring (c1ccccc1) and the exocyclic alkene (C=CC(=O)O). The benzene carbons typically resonate between 125–135 ppm, while the alkene carbon adjacent to the carboxylic acid appears near 140 ppm due to deshielding from the electron-withdrawing group. 3. **Heterocyclic and sulfur-bound carbons (50–70 ppm):** Peaks at ~65 ppm and ~55 ppm correspond to the thiazolidine ring carbons (CS[C@H]12), particularly the carbon adjacent to sulfur (C-S) and the methine carbon bearing the amino group. These shifts are consistent with sp³ carbons in a strained ring system. 4. **Aliphatic carbons (20–40 ppm):** Minor peaks in this range may arise from the methylene (CH₂) or methine (CH) groups in the side chains, though their low intensity suggests limited aliphatic character in the molecule. The spectrum’s diversity in chemical shifts aligns with the molecule’s functional groups: a β-lactam ring, carboxylic acid, amide, thiazolidine sulfur, and aromatic moiety. The absence of peaks below 20 ppm confirms the lack of methyl groups, while the distribution of intensities reflects the molecule’s polar, conjugated framework. This analysis underscores the utility of C-NMR in resolving structural motifs critical to the molecule’s biological activity, such as the β-lactam and carboxylate functionalities."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C9H6ClN3O3 (SMILES: O=C(O)Cn1nnc2cc(Cl)ccc2c1=O). The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule's diverse chemical environments. The most prominent peak near 160–170 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid group (O=C(O)), which typically appears in this downfield region due to the strong deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen atoms. Adjacent to this, a slightly less intense peak around 150–160 ppm likely arises from the carbonyl carbon within the fused triazole-benzene ring system (c1=O), further deshielded by the adjacent nitrogen atoms in the heterocycle. In the aromatic region (110–140 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, consistent with the substituted benzene ring (c2–c6). The chlorine substituent at position 7 (based on SMILES notation) induces a downfield shift in the adjacent aromatic carbons, particularly evident for the carbon directly bonded to chlorine (expected ~130–140 ppm) and its ortho/para counterparts. The triazole ring (n1nnc2) contributes additional resonances in the 120–140 ppm range, as sp²-hybridized carbons in nitrogen-rich heterocycles typically exhibit shifts in this window. A well-defined peak near 50–60 ppm is assignable to the methylene carbon (Cn) linking the carboxylic acid to the triazole ring. This carbon experiences moderate deshielding due to its proximity to the electron-withdrawing triazole and carboxyl groups. A smaller peak in the 20–30 ppm region may correspond to a quaternary carbon in the triazole ring or a deshielded aliphatic carbon, though its exact assignment requires further context. The spectrum’s overall pattern aligns with the molecular complexity of C9H6ClN3O3, with nine distinct carbon environments reflecting the carboxylic acid, aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic components. The absence of peaks above 180 ppm confirms the lack of aldehyde or ketone functionalities beyond the observed carbonyls. This C-NMR data provides critical insights into the molecule’s structural motifs, corroborating the proposed SMILES notation and highlighting the influence of electronegative substituents on chemical shift dispersion."

Key observations include: 1. **Aliphatic region (0.9–2.5 ppm):** - A prominent singlet at **0.9 ppm** (intensity ~0.18) corresponds to the angular methyl group (C18 or C19) in the steroid core. - A singlet at **1.2 ppm** (intensity ~0.15) likely arises from the methyl group of the propionate ester (CH₃CH₂COO–). - A broad multiplet at **2.1–2.4 ppm** (intensity ~0.10–0.12) reflects methylene protons adjacent to carbonyl groups (e.g., C21 in the ketone moiety or C2 and C4 in the ester side chains). 2. **Oxygenated region (3.5–5.0 ppm):** - A quartet at **4.1 ppm** (intensity ~0.08) and a broader signal at **4.7 ppm** (intensity ~0.06) are consistent with methylene protons (CH₂) in the ester linkages (O–CH₂–CH₃), split by coupling with adjacent methyl groups. 3. **Vinyl and aromatic-like region (5.0–6.0 ppm):** - A sharp singlet at **5.7 ppm** (intensity ~0.05) indicates a vinylic proton (C6–H) in the conjugated enone system (C5=C6–C7=O) of the steroid A-ring. 4. **Aromatic region (6.0–8.0 ppm):** - A minor singlet at **7.2 ppm** (intensity ~0.02) likely corresponds to residual chloroform (CHCl₃), a common solvent impurity in NMR samples. The spectrum reflects the molecule’s structural complexity, including the steroid backbone, two propionate ester side chains, and a conjugated ketone. The chemical shifts and splitting patterns align with expected environments: deshielded protons near electronegative oxygen atoms (ester and ketone), shielded methyl groups in the rigid steroid framework, and a vinylic proton in the enone system. The absence of broad signals in the 10–12 ppm range confirms no exchangeable protons (e.g., –OH or –COOH) are present. This H-NMR profile is consistent with a synthetic steroid ester, such as a derivative of testosterone or nandrolone modified with propionate groups at C3 and C17 positions."

The aromatic ring system (c2ccccc2) contributes to multiple absorptions between 1600–1450 cm⁻¹, including C=C stretching and C-H bending modes. A prominent band near 1250 cm⁻¹ is attributed to C-O stretching in the ester and ether (OCCCN) linkages.

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C27H34N4O (SMILES: Nc1cc(CN2CCN(C(c3ccccc3)c3ccccc3)CC2)ccc1NCCCO). The spectrum displays several key features characteristic of this compound's fragmentation pattern under mass spectrometric analysis. The molecular ion peak (M⁺) appears at m/z 431, confirming the molecular weight of 430.6 g/mol as calculated from the molecular formula. A prominent base peak at m/z 179 dominates the spectrum, suggesting a highly stable fragment likely derived from the diphenylmethyl group (C₆H₅)₂CH⁺, a common fragmentation pathway for structures containing this moiety. Additional significant peaks include m/z 167 (possibly corresponding to the piperazine ring system with adjacent phenyl groups), m/z 152 (indicative of a fragment retaining part of the aromatic amine and piperazine structure), and m/z 144 (potentially representing a loss of 18 Da (H₂O) from the base peak). The peak at m/z 133 may arise from further fragmentation of the piperazine ring, while m/z 120 and 110 suggest cleavage of the propyl alcohol side chain (NCCCO). Notably, the presence of peaks at m/z 180 and 168 (isotopic clusters) hints at protonated or rearranged fragments, while m/z 161 and 159 could correspond to aromatic ring-containing fragments with nitrogen atoms. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 431 confirms the molecular ion's integrity, and the lack of major peaks below m/z 100 suggests minimal small-molecule fragmentation (e.g., loss of CH₃ or NH₂ groups). This fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the compound: a diphenylmethyl-substituted piperazine core connected to an aminopropyl alcohol side chain. The stability of the m/z 179 fragment reflects the resonance stabilization of the diphenylmethyl cation, while the distribution of lower-m/z peaks provides insight into the cleavage of N-C and C-O bonds in the side chain and heterocyclic ring. Such spectral characteristics are consistent with protonated molecular ions undergoing predictable bond cleavage in electron ionization mass spectrometry."

The most downfield ¹H chemical shifts (12–10 ppm) correspond to deshielded protons, likely aromatic or amide protons, attached to carbons resonating between 100–150 ppm, consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons in conjugated systems. A prominent peak at ~12 ppm (¹H) and ~150 ppm (¹³C) suggests a proton attached to a carbon near electronegative substituents, such as a carbonyl or heteroaromatic system. Peaks in the 8–6 ppm (¹H) range with ¹³C shifts of 100–120 ppm align with aromatic CH groups in benzene or pyridine rings, which are prevalent in the structure.

The spectrum displays distinct carbon environments consistent with the structural features of the compound. The most downfield resonance near 200 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the indole-derived ketone group, which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen atom. Several peaks in the 150–170 ppm range are attributed to aromatic carbons attached to electronegative atoms, including the pyridine ring (C2, C4, and C6 positions) and the methoxy-substituted benzene ring. The sulfonyl group (-SO2-) induces deshielding in adjacent aromatic carbons, contributing to resonances observed near 140–150 ppm. In the 100–140 ppm region, multiple peaks correspond to the remaining aromatic carbons of the pyridine and benzene rings, as well as the indole core. The methoxy group (-OCH3) appears as a singlet near 55 ppm, reflecting its electron-donating effect and shielding of the attached carbon. Aliphatic regions (0–50 ppm) show resonances for the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) at ~28 ppm, which appears as a single peak due to symmetry, and the methyl group attached to the indole nitrogen (~20 ppm).

The spectrum’s peak distribution aligns with the molecule’s 24 unique carbon environments, though some overlap may occur due to similar chemical shifts. The absence of peaks below 0 ppm or above 200 ppm confirms the absence of highly shielded or exceptionally deshielded carbons beyond the expected functional groups. This C-NMR spectrum provides clear evidence of the compound’s aromaticity, heterocyclic components, and aliphatic substituents, consistent with the proposed structure."

These correspond to aromatic CH groups on the benzene ring, influenced by the electron-withdrawing bromine and NCCF substituents.

Bromine’s strong inductive effect significantly deshields this proton, causing its unusually downfield shift. The HSQC spectrum confirms the presence of all expected CH, CH₂, and CH₃ groups in the molecule, with chemical shifts consistent with the substituted aromatic ring and NCCF side chain. Quaternary carbons (e.g., the carbon bearing Br or the aromatic carbon bonded to N) are absent in HSQC, as expected.

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups present in this structure. A broad, moderate-intensity peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the N-H stretching vibration of the amide group, while the sharp peak at ~2900 cm⁻¹ corresponds to C-H stretching vibrations in the alkyl chain. The most prominent feature is the intense, sharp band at ~1700 cm⁻¹, indicative of the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration in the ester group, with a slightly lower wavenumber peak at ~1650 cm⁻¹ likely arising from the amide C=O stretch. Additional bands at ~1500 cm⁻¹ and ~1400 cm⁻¹ are consistent with C-N stretching and N-H bending vibrations in the amide moiety. The ester group also contributes to the strong absorption near 1200 cm⁻¹ (C-O stretching), while the fingerprint region below 1500 cm⁻¹ contains complex overlapping peaks from C-C and C-N vibrations in the pyrrolidine ring and alkyl chain. The absence of hydroxyl (O-H) or aromatic C=C stretching bands aligns with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of saturated aliphatic and carbonyl-containing functional groups. This spectral profile is consistent with the assigned structure, which includes a chiral center (indicated by the [C@@H] notation) and both amide and ester functionalities."

The spectrum exhibits several prominent peaks corresponding to molecular fragments and isotopic distributions. The base peak at m/z 364, with 100% relative abundance, likely represents a stable fragment ion formed via cleavage of the tert-butyl ketone moiety (C4H9), consistent with the loss of a 57 Da neutral fragment from the protonated molecular ion. The molecular ion peak is observed at m/z 422, corresponding to the calculated molecular weight of the compound (421.48 g/mol), with the [M+H]+ ion dominating the high-mass region. Additional significant peaks include m/z 365 (relative abundance ~40%), which may arise from isotopic contributions (e.g., ¹³C or ³⁴S) or alternative fragmentation pathways. Peaks at m/z 305 and 306 suggest further degradation of the thiazolidinedione ring system (C=C4S(=O)NC(=O)C4=O), potentially losing a 117 Da fragment. The cluster of peaks at m/z 202, 208, and 209 likely corresponds to smaller aromatic or heterocyclic fragments, possibly retaining sulfur or nitrogen-rich substructures. The peak at m/z 202 may represent a benzimidazole or indole-like fragment, while m/z 208 and 209 could indicate sulfur-containing ions with isotopic splitting (³²S vs. ³⁴S). Lower-intensity peaks between m/z 337–338 and 364–365 suggest minor fragmentation pathways involving partial decomposition of the core structure. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 422 confirms no detectable dimerization or adduct formation. This fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, particularly the labile tert-butyl group and the electron-rich heterocyclic systems, which are prone to cleavage under ionization conditions. The spectrum provides critical insights into the compound’s stability and structural motifs, aiding in its identification and characterization."

The most downfield peak at approximately 169 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the amide group, which is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Aromatic carbons are observed between 145–120 ppm, with four distinct signals in this region.

A singlet at ~60 ppm indicates a carbon adjacent to an oxygen atom, assigned to the CH2 group in the oxazolidine ring (O-CH2). The methine carbon (CH) of the oxazolidine ring appears at ~55 ppm, slightly upfield due to its attachment to both nitrogen and oxygen. Two methyl groups are observed: the aromatic methyl (C-CH3) resonates at ~20 ppm, and the methyl group on the oxazolidine ring (N-CH3) appears at ~15 ppm, both in the typical aliphatic region. The absence of additional peaks suggests no unexpected impurities or structural anomalies. The integration of intensities aligns with the molecular formula, confirming the presence of one carbonyl, four aromatic carbons, two oxygen-bound carbons, and three aliphatic carbons (two methyl and one methine).

A broad, moderate-intensity peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the N–H stretching vibration of the secondary amide group, which is consistent with the presence of the –NH– moiety in the structure. Sharp, intense peaks in the 3000–3100 cm⁻¹ region correspond to aromatic C–H stretching vibrations from the three phenyl rings, while weaker absorptions near 2850–2950 cm⁻¹ arise from aliphatic C–H stretching in the methylene (–CH2–) and methine (–CH–) groups. The most prominent feature is the strong, sharp carbonyl (C=O) stretching band at approximately 1650 cm⁻¹, which is diagnostic of the amide functional group. This peak’s position aligns with typical values for secondary amides, where resonance delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair reduces the C=O bond order compared to ketones or aldehydes. Additional peaks in the 1450–1600 cm⁻¹ range correspond to aromatic C=C stretching vibrations, further confirming the presence of multiple phenyl rings. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), complex absorptions between 1000–1300 cm⁻¹ are likely due to C–N stretching vibrations and bending modes of the amide group, as well as C–H in-plane deformations from the aromatic systems. The absence of significant absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ rules out free ketone or carboxylic acid groups, while the lack of broad O–H stretching bands (3200–3600 cm⁻¹) confirms the absence of hydroxyl groups.

The ¹H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans from -2 to 14 ppm, while the ¹³C axis (y-axis) ranges from -200 to 0 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm, 120–140 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to the protonated aromatic carbons of the benzimidazole core (c2ccccc2 and c3ccc(C)cc3 substituents). The ¹H shifts at 6.8–7.8 ppm align with typical aromatic protons, while their bonded carbons appear at 110–135 ppm. The benzimidazole ring (n2c1ccccc1n(-c3ccc(C)cc3)c2) exhibits distinct correlations, reflecting its electron-deficient heterocyclic nature. 2. **Aliphatic Chain (1–4 ppm, 20–70 ppm):** The ¹H signals at 1.2–1.8 ppm and 3.4–3.8 ppm correlate with methylene (CH₂) protons in the hexyloxy linker (CCCCCO). Their bonded carbons appear at 25–30 ppm (CH₂) and 65–70 ppm (OCH₂), consistent with oxygen-adjacent carbons.

The peak near 150 ppm corresponds to the carbon atoms in the aromatic rings directly bonded to electronegative substituents, such as the fluorine atom (C–F) or nitrogen atoms (C–N), which deshield the nuclei and shift their resonances downfield. The cluster of peaks between 110–130 ppm arises from the aromatic carbons in the benzene rings, with variations in chemical shift due to the influence of substituents (e.g., fluorine’s electron-withdrawing effects and nitrogen’s lone pair interactions). The resonance at ~50 ppm is attributed to the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the secondary amine (–CH–N), which experiences moderate shielding. The peak at ~20 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (–CH3) attached to the aromatic ring, a typical upfield shift for sp3-hybridized carbons. Notably, the absence of significant splitting in the peaks suggests the lack of strong carbon-phosphorus or carbon-fluorine coupling, which is consistent with the molecule’s structure.

The benzodioxole ring (fused to the acetal group) and the benzyl group (–CH2Ph) exhibit chemically distinct carbons due to their substitution patterns. The oxygenated aromatic carbons (adjacent to the acetal oxygen) likely resonate near 140–150 ppm, while unsubstituted aromatic carbons appear at lower shifts (120–130 ppm). The aliphatic region (0–100 ppm) shows several key features. A peak near 70–80 ppm is consistent with the acetal carbon (C1 in the SMILES), which is bonded to two oxygen atoms and two methyl groups.

The most prominent peaks occur at chemical shifts of approximately 6.3 ppm, 3.8 ppm, 2.8 ppm, and 1.2 ppm. The intense peak at **6.3 ppm** corresponds to the aromatic protons of the two benzene rings and the fused thiazole-benzene system. The para-substituted benzene ring (attached to the diethylamino group) and the methoxy-substituted benzene in the fused ring system contribute to this region, with protons experiencing deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms. The **3.8 ppm** singlet is attributed to the methoxy group (-OCH3) on the fused benzene ring, a typical chemical shift for protons adjacent to an oxygen atom. The **2.8 ppm** peak arises from the methylene protons (-CH2-) of the diethylamino group (-N(CH2CH3)2). These protons are deshielded by the electronegative nitrogen atom, shifting their resonance downfield. The **1.2 ppm** triplet corresponds to the terminal methyl groups (-CH3) of the ethyl chains, which are shielded and appear upfield.

The spectrum displays characteristic proton resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm. Key features include: 1. **Aliphatic Region (0–3 ppm):** - A singlet near **1.0 ppm** corresponds to the tert-butyl group (CCC(C)(C)), with its nine equivalent methyl protons producing a sharp, high-intensity peak. - A broad multiplet at **~2.0 ppm** arises from the CH₂ protons in the pyrrolidine ring (N1CCCC1), which are deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl group. - A smaller peak at **~2.5 ppm** likely represents the CH₂ group adjacent to the enone carbonyl (C(=O)CH₂CH₂CH=CH–), experiencing moderate deshielding. 2. **Olefinic and Carbonyl-Adjacent Protons (3–6 ppm):** - A resonance at **~3.5 ppm** may correspond to the CH₂ group adjacent to the pyrrolidine carbonyl (N–C(=O)–CH₂–), influenced by the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl. - A peak at **~5.0 ppm** is attributed to the benzyl methylene protons (OCH₂Ph), which are slightly deshielded by the aromatic ring and oxygen atom. - A multiplet at **~5.8 ppm** represents the vinyl protons of the conjugated alkene (CH=CH–), with coupling patterns reflecting their trans-configuration. 3. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm):** - Peaks between **7.0–7.5 ppm** correspond to aromatic protons. The benzyl-protected phenyl ring (c1ccc(OCc2ccccc2)cc1) exhibits a pair of doublets near **~6.8 ppm** and **~7.2 ppm** (para-substitution pattern), while the benzyl group’s aromatic protons (c2ccccc2) appear as a complex multiplet near **~7.3 ppm**. 4. **High-Field Anomaly (10 ppm):** - A sharp singlet at **~10 ppm** is observed, though this does not align with the expected proton environments in the given structure. This peak may indicate an impurity, solvent residue (e.g., formic acid), or an artifact from sample preparation. The spectrum reflects the molecule’s structural complexity, with distinct signals for aliphatic, olefinic, and aromatic protons. The integration and splitting patterns align with the proposed SMILES notation, though the anomalous peak at 10 ppm warrants further investigation for purity assessment."

A prominent singlet at ~2.0 ppm, with the highest intensity, likely arises from the three equivalent protons of the ethyl ester’s methyl group (-OCH2CH3), which is deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom. A sharp singlet near ~10.5 ppm corresponds to the NH proton of the indole-like ring system, consistent with its typical deshielded position due to hydrogen bonding and aromatic ring currents. A multiplet at ~7.0–7.5 ppm integrates to four aromatic protons from the benzene ring fused to the heterocycle, exhibiting splitting patterns characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene derivative. A quartet at ~4.2 ppm (partially overlapping with baseline noise) is assignable to the two protons of the ethyl ester’s methylene group (-OCH2-), split by coupling with the adjacent methyl group. Additional peaks at ~1.2–1.5 ppm (a broad multiplet) likely correspond to the cyclopropyl ring’s protons (C2CC2), which experience an upfield shift due to their aliphatic nature and proximity to the electron-rich indole system. The absence of peaks above 12 ppm indicates no carboxylic acid or aldehyde protons, aligning with the ester functionality in the structure. The spectrum’s features collectively confirm the presence of the ethyl ester, cyclopropyl, NH, and aromatic moieties in the molecule, with chemical shifts and splitting patterns consistent with the proposed structure."

A prominent bromine isotope pattern is evident, with peaks at m/z 348 and 349 (separated by 1 Da) and m/z 279 and 280, consistent with the natural abundance of Br-79 and Br-81 isotopes. The base peak at m/z 243 suggests a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage adjacent to the ester group (CCOC=O), generating a resonance-stabilized carbocation. Additional significant peaks at m/z 252, 294, and 365 may correspond to fragments retaining the brominated aromatic ring system, with losses of alkyl groups (e.g., isopropyl or tert-butyl moieties) contributing to the observed pattern. The fluorine atom influences fragmentation pathways, as seen in the m/z 349 peak, which may result from a retro-Diels-Alder reaction or allylic cleavage near the fluorinated alkene. Peaks at m/z 433 and 468 suggest partial retention of the aromatic core with varying degrees of alkyl substitution. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 547 confirms the molecular weight, while the distribution of lower-mass fragments reflects the molecule’s structural complexity, including conjugated double bonds and sterically hindered substituents. This spectrum highlights characteristic fragmentation trends for halogenated, unsaturated esters, with bromine’s isotopic signature serving as a key diagnostic feature."

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups present in the molecule. A strong, sharp peak at approximately 3300 cm⁻¹ is indicative of N–H stretching, though its presence is unexpected given the absence of an N–H bond in the provided SMILES. This may suggest a minor tautomeric form or impurity, but the dominant structure likely involves alternative vibrational contributions. The prominent absorption near 2960 cm⁻¹ corresponds to C–H stretching vibrations from the tert-butyl (C(CH₃)₃) and propyl (CCC) groups, with additional C–H bending modes observed around 1450 cm⁻¹. The intense band at ~1050 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the S=O stretching vibration of the sulfoxide group, a hallmark of the [S@@](=O) moiety. A moderate peak near 1650 cm⁻¹ aligns with the C=N stretching vibration of the imine (Schiff base) group, confirming the presence of the CCC=N– linkage. The absence of broad O–H or N–H absorption in the 2500–3500 cm⁻¹ region further supports the lack of hydroxyl or secondary amine groups.

The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances characteristic of aromatic, aliphatic, and functional group environments. Key features include a prominent singlet near 10 ppm, likely corresponding to the aromatic proton ortho to the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl (S(=O)₂) group, which deshields the proton significantly. A triplet and quartet pattern between 7–8 ppm suggests aromatic protons on the fluorinated benzene ring, with splitting influenced by vicinal coupling and the fluorine substituent. The fluorine atom itself induces a doublet splitting in adjacent protons due to ¹⁹F-¹H coupling, observable in the 7–8 ppm region. A sharp singlet near 3.8 ppm corresponds to the methoxy (OCH₃) group, while a multiplet around 3.5 ppm integrates to the two protons of the ethyl group (CH₂) adjacent to the piperazine ring. The piperazine protons appear as broad multiplets between 2.5–3.0 ppm, reflecting their dynamic conformational exchange. A singlet near 2.5 ppm is assigned to the methyl (CH₃) group attached to the sulfonyl-bearing aromatic ring, deshielded by the electron-withdrawing S(=O)₂ moiety. Additional aromatic protons on the non-fluorinated ring resonate between 6–7 ppm, with integration consistent with their substitution pattern.

The most prominent peak at 1.4 ppm (singlet) corresponds to the nine equivalent protons of the tert-butyl group in the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group. This high-field shift and singlet splitting pattern are characteristic of a sterically shielded, non-coupled tertiary alkyl group. A moderate-intensity singlet at 2.5 ppm is attributed to the three protons of the methyl group directly attached to the 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring. The deshielded position of this peak reflects the electron-withdrawing influence of the adjacent heteroaromatic system. A singlet at 4.4 ppm (two protons) arises from the methylene (CH2) bridge connecting the oxadiazole ring to the Boc-protected amine. This intermediate chemical shift indicates the CH2 group’s proximity to both the electron-deficient oxadiazole and the carbonyl moiety of the Boc group. Finally, a low-intensity singlet at 7.5 ppm is assigned to the NH proton of the carbamate. Its downfield position suggests hydrogen bonding with the carbonyl oxygen, a common feature for Boc-protected amines. The absence of coupling in all signals indicates no significant J-coupling between these proton environments, consistent with the molecule’s symmetry and substitution pattern. The integration ratios (9:3:2:1) align perfectly with the molecular formula, confirming the structural assignment. No extraneous peaks are observed, indicating high sample purity.

The most downfield ¹H chemical shift (~11 ppm) correlates with a ¹³C signal near 170 ppm, consistent with a carbonyl-adjacent proton, likely from the acetyl group (C(C)=O) where the methyl protons experience deshielding. A cluster of aromatic ¹H signals (6.8–7.5 ppm) correlates with ¹³C shifts in the 120–140 ppm range, corresponding to the substituted benzene ring.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei through one-bond scalar couplings (¹JCH), enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the structure. The spectrum displays distinct clusters of cross-peaks that correspond to specific functional groups and structural motifs in the molecule. In the aromatic region of the ¹H dimension (6.5–8.0 ppm), several cross-peaks are observed, correlating with ¹³C shifts in the range of 120–140 ppm. These signals arise from the two aromatic rings in the molecule: the chlorophenyl group (c2ccc(Cl)cc2) and the tetrahydroisoquinoline-derived benzene ring (c1ccc2c(c1)CNCC2). The presence of chlorine on one aromatic ring induces a deshielding effect, shifting its protonated carbons slightly downfield compared to the unsubstituted ring. In the aliphatic region of the ¹H dimension (1.0–4.5 ppm), a dense cluster of cross-peaks is observed, corresponding to ¹³C shifts between 20–60 ppm. These peaks originate from the piperidine ring (N1CCC(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)CC1) and the methylene chains adjacent to nitrogen atoms (e.g., CNCC2 and CCC(=O)N). The protons on carbons directly bonded to nitrogen (e.g., CH₂-N) appear at higher ¹H chemical shifts (3.0–4.0 ppm) due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitrogen atom. The carbonyl carbons (O=C) in the molecule (amide and ketone groups) do not appear in the HSQC spectrum, as they lack directly attached protons. However, the methylene protons adjacent to the carbonyls (e.g., CH₂-C=O) are visible, with ¹H shifts near 2.5–3.0 ppm and ¹³C shifts around 30–40 ppm. Notably, the spectrum lacks significant peaks in the ¹H region above 10 ppm, indicating the absence of strongly acidic protons (e.g., -OH or -NH in exchangeable positions) under the experimental conditions. The overall distribution of cross-peaks aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the aromatic systems, aliphatic chains, and heterocyclic components. This HSQC data serves as a critical tool for assigning protonated carbons and validating the connectivity of the molecule’s framework."

A broad, moderately intense peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ is indicative of O-H stretching vibrations, consistent with the hydroxyl group attached to the tetrahydropyran ring (C3(O)CCOCC3). This peak’s broadness suggests hydrogen bonding, typical for alcohols. Sharp peaks in the 2800–3000 cm⁻¹ region correspond to C-H stretching vibrations in aliphatic (methylene groups in the tetrahydropyran and methoxy groups) and aromatic (pyridine and furan rings) environments. The aromatic C-H stretches appear as weaker, sharper peaks near 3050–3100 cm⁻¹. A prominent, intense absorption band near 1050 cm⁻¹ is attributed to C-O stretching vibrations, which aligns with the ether linkage in the methoxy group (COc1...) and the cyclic ether in the tetrahydropyran ring. This region is a key diagnostic feature for ethers and alcohols. Additional weaker peaks in the 1200–1300 cm⁻¹ range may arise from C-N stretching in the pyridine ring (nccc) or C-O-C asymmetric stretching in the ether functionalities. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays a complex pattern of peaks, including potential contributions from C-C stretching and bending vibrations in the aromatic rings (pyridine and furan) and the tetrahydropyran ring. Notably, the absence of strong absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of carbonyl (C=O) groups, consistent with the molecular formula.

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at approximately 270 ppm is characteristic of the carbonyl carbon in the isocyanate group (N=C=O), which is highly deshielded due to the electronegativity of the adjacent oxygen and nitrogen atoms. This region is typical for sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons in such functional groups. Additional peaks in the 150–160 ppm range correspond to aromatic carbons directly bonded to electronegative atoms. Specifically, the carbon in the pyridine ring adjacent to the nitrogen (position 2) and the ipso carbon of the benzene ring attached to the oxygen atom exhibit downfield shifts due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the heteroatoms. Peaks between 120–140 ppm represent other aromatic carbons in the benzene and pyridine rings, with their exact positions influenced by substitution patterns and conjugation effects. The benzene ring’s ortho and para carbons relative to the oxygen substituent likely contribute to this region, while the pyridine ring’s remaining carbons (positions 3, 4, and 5) also resonate here. A notable peak at ~40 ppm arises from the quaternary carbon of the tert-butyl group (C(CH₃)₃), which is slightly deshielded due to its attachment to the oxygen atom in the ether linkage. The methyl carbons of the tert-butyl group typically appear in the 25–35 ppm range but may overlap with baseline noise or exhibit lower intensity in this spectrum. The absence of peaks below 20 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic or methyl groups outside the tert-butyl moiety. The spectrum’s simplicity in the aliphatic region aligns with the molecule’s structure, which contains no other saturated carbons. Overall, the chemical shifts and peak intensities are consistent with the proposed structure, reflecting the electronic environments of the aromatic systems, the isocyanate group, and the tert-butyl substituent."

Adjacent to this, a peak at ~10 ppm is attributed to the amide NH proton (–NC(=O)–), which is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl groups. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), two peaks at ~7.5 ppm and ~7.3 ppm are observed. These arise from the two equivalent aromatic protons on the dichlorinated benzene ring (positions 3 and 5 in the substituted phenyl group), which are deshielded by the electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms and the amide substituent. The symmetry of the benzene ring (para-disubstituted with Cl and amide groups) results in equivalent chemical environments for these protons, though slight splitting may arise from coupling with neighboring nuclei or solvent effects. A singlet at ~5.5 ppm corresponds to the pyrazole ring’s NH proton (n[nH]c1=O), which is deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl group. The isopropyl group attached to the pyrazole ring generates two distinct signals: a septet at ~2.8 ppm (1H, –CH(CH3)2) and a doublet at ~1.2 ppm (6H, –CH(CH3)2), consistent with the splitting pattern of an isopropyl moiety. The tallest peak at ~2 ppm, though not directly assignable to the molecular structure, may represent a solvent signal (e.g., residual DMSO-d6 or water) or an artifact, as no protons in the given SMILES correspond to this region.

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C8H5BrF4 (SMILES: Fc1cc(Br)ccc1CC(F)(F)F). The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates 1H and 13C chemical shifts for directly bonded proton-carbon pairs, providing insights into the molecular structure. In this spectrum, two distinct regions of cross-peaks are observed. The first region, located between 6.5–8.0 ppm in the 1H dimension and 120–150 ppm in the 13C dimension, corresponds to aromatic protons and their directly attached carbons. The molecule contains a monosubstituted benzene ring with fluorine (F) and bromine (Br) substituents, which deshield adjacent protons and carbons, shifting their signals downfield. The cross-peaks in this region likely arise from the aromatic protons ortho and meta to the halogen substituents, with the fluorine’s strong electronegativity causing significant 13C shifts for adjacent carbons. A second cross-peak cluster appears near 3.0–3.5 ppm (1H) and 30–40 ppm (13C), consistent with the methylene (CH2) group adjacent to the trifluoromethyl (CF3) moiety. The CH2 protons are deshielded by the electron-withdrawing CF3 group, shifting their 1H signals downfield compared to typical aliphatic protons. The corresponding 13C shifts for this CH2 group are also elevated due to the inductive effects of the fluorine atoms. Notably, the CF3 group itself does not produce HSQC cross-peaks, as it lacks directly attached protons. The absence of additional cross-peaks confirms the presence of only two protonated carbon environments: the aromatic ring and the CH2 linker. This aligns with the molecular formula C8H5BrF4, where the remaining carbons (including the CF3 group) are either quaternary or non-protonated. The spectrum effectively validates the connectivity of the aromatic and aliphatic regions in the molecule, with the HSQC correlations directly mapping the spatial relationships between protons and their bonded carbons."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C14H15F3O4S (SMILES: COc1ccc(CC2CC=CC2)c(OS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c1). The spectrum displays several prominent peaks that provide insights into the molecular structure and fragmentation patterns. The molecular ion peak at m/z 337 corresponds to the intact molecule, confirming the molecular weight of 336.33 g/mol (calculated for C14H15F3O4S). The base peak at m/z 137, representing the most abundant fragment, likely arises from cleavage of the sulfonate ester bond (O-S), generating a phenoxonium ion stabilized by resonance with the methoxy-substituted aromatic ring. A significant peak at m/z 269 suggests loss of the triflate group (CF3SO3, 149 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for sulfonate esters. Additional peaks at m/z 81 and 111 may correspond to fragments from the cyclopentene ring (C5H5+, 65 Da) and its substituted derivatives. Peaks at m/z 155 and 175 could arise from cleavage of the methoxy group (OCH3, 31 Da) and subsequent rearrangements. The cluster of peaks between m/z 200–270, including 203, 209, 226, and 245, likely reflects complex fragmentations involving the aromatic ring, cyclopentene moiety, and residual sulfonate fragments. The absence of significant isotopic peaks for sulfur (³²S vs. ³⁴S) or fluorine (¹⁹F) is consistent with their natural abundance patterns. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern aligns with the proposed structure, where the triflate group (OSO2CF3) acts as a labile site for homolytic cleavage, while the aromatic and cycloalkene components contribute to stable cationic fragments. This analysis underscores the utility of mass spectrometry in elucidating structural motifs through characteristic fragmentation pathways."

The spectrum exhibits distinct peaks across three primary regions, reflecting the molecule's aromatic, carbonyl, and alkoxy functional groups. The most prominent peak at approximately 160 ppm corresponds to the ester carbonyl carbon (COO-) of the methoxycarbonyl substituent, a hallmark of electron-withdrawing groups in aromatic systems. Adjacent to this, a sharp signal near 50 ppm arises from the methoxy (-OCH3) carbon, consistent with its deshielded environment due to oxygen electronegativity. Between 110–130 ppm, a series of overlapping peaks reflects the aromatic carbons of the biphenyl and naphthalene-like moieties. The substitution pattern of the aromatic rings—para- and meta-oriented groups—creates distinct chemical environments, splitting signals across this range. Notably, the carbon directly bonded to the cyano group (-C#N) appears as a singlet near 115 ppm, a downfield shift attributable to the electron-withdrawing nitrile. The naphthalene system contributes additional complexity, with peri- and ortho-coupled carbons exhibiting intermediate shifts (120–128 ppm) due to ring current effects and substituent interactions. The absence of signals below 50 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic carbons, while the lack of peaks above 170 ppm excludes additional carbonyl groups. The spectrum’s peak multiplicity and dispersion align with the molecule’s rigid, conjugated structure, where symmetry in the naphthalene moiety reduces the number of unique carbon environments. This analysis corroborates the proposed structure, highlighting the interplay of aromaticity, electron-withdrawing substituents, and conjugation in shaping the NMR profile."

The spectrum displays correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei directly bonded to each other, providing insights into the molecular structure. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (¹H: 6.5–8.0 ppm; ¹³C: 120–140 ppm):** A cluster of peaks in this region corresponds to the two substituted benzene rings in the molecule. The aromatic protons (e.g., from the c1ccc(...)c(C)c1 and c1ccc(OCc2ccccc2)c(C)c1 fragments) exhibit chemical shifts typical of electron-rich aromatic systems, with their attached carbons appearing in the expected range for sp²-hybridized carbons. 2. **Aliphatic Region (¹H: 0.5–3.0 ppm; ¹³C: 10–60 ppm):** Peaks in this area reflect the ethyl groups (CCC(CC)) and methyl substituents (e.g., c(C)c1 and C(C)C). The triplet-like splitting for some peaks suggests coupling in CH₂ groups, while singlets correspond to isolated methyl groups. The central quaternary carbon (CCC(CC)) is not directly visible in HSQC, as it lacks attached protons. 3. **Oxygen-Bound Protons (¹H: 3.5–4.5 ppm; ¹³C: 60–80 ppm):** A distinct group of correlations arises from the OCH₂ groups in the OCH₂C(C)C and OCH₂Ph fragments. These protons appear downfield due to deshielding by electronegative oxygen atoms, with their attached carbons resonating in the 60–70 ppm range. 4. **Carbonyl Adjacent Protons (¹H: ~2.5 ppm; ¹³C: ~40 ppm):** A peak near 2.5 ppm (¹H) and 40 ppm (¹³C) likely corresponds to the methylene protons adjacent to the carbonyl group (OCH₂C(=O)), though the carbonyl carbon itself is not observed in HSQC. The spectrum’s dispersion of peaks across these regions aligns with the molecule’s structural complexity, including aromaticity, aliphatic chains, and oxygenated functional groups. The absence of correlations for quaternary carbons (e.g., the central carbon of CCC(CC)) and carbonyl carbons is consistent with HSQC’s proton-detection bias. This data enables precise assignment of protonated carbons, aiding in the verification of the molecule’s connectivity and substitution pattern."

The most downfield peak, observed near 170 ppm, corresponds to the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (C1), which is highly deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen and resonance effects. Adjacent to this, a cluster of peaks in the 120–140 ppm range reflects the sp²-hybridized carbons of the cis double bond (C9 and C10), which are slightly shielded compared to carbonyl carbons but remain downfield due to their unsaturated nature. Two prominent peaks near 50–60 ppm arise from the epoxide carbons (C12 and C13), which experience deshielding from the oxygen atom in the three-membered ring. The aliphatic region (0–50 ppm) contains multiple peaks, including a terminal methyl group (C18) near 14 ppm, methylene groups (C2–C8, C11, C14–C17) spanning 20–35 ppm, and the methylene adjacent to the carboxylic acid (C2) slightly downfield (~30 ppm) due to its proximity to the electron-withdrawing group. The cis configuration of the double bond and the stereochemistry of the epoxide (as indicated by the SMILES) likely result in non-equivalent environments for adjacent carbons, contributing to the multiplicity of peaks in these regions. The overall pattern aligns with the expected chemical shifts for a C18 fatty acid backbone modified by an epoxide and unsaturation, with no unexpected signals indicating impurities or structural deviations."

The ¹H chemical shifts range from 0 to 14 ppm, while the ¹³C shifts span 0 to 200 ppm. Notably, several distinct cross-peaks are observed, corresponding to specific proton-carbon pairs in the structure. The peak at approximately 7.8 ppm (¹H) and 155 ppm (¹³C) likely corresponds to the aromatic protons and carbons of the pyrimidine ring (ncn1), where deshielding effects from the adjacent nitrogen atoms elevate the ¹³C shifts. A cluster of peaks near 3.5–4.0 ppm (¹H) and 60–70 ppm (¹³C) reflects the morpholine ring (N2CCOCC2), with the ¹³C shifts indicating methylene carbons adjacent to oxygen and nitrogen. The sulfoxide group (O=S) influences the chemical environment of the benzylic CH₂ group (Cc1), which appears as a peak around 4.5 ppm (¹H) and 55 ppm (¹³C), consistent with deshielding by the electron-withdrawing sulfoxide. Additional peaks at 7.2–7.5 ppm (¹H) and 120–130 ppm (¹³C) correspond to the thiazole ring (c1nc2cscc2[nH]1), where aromatic protons and carbons exhibit characteristic shifts. The low-field ¹H peak at ~12 ppm (¹H) and ~150 ppm (¹³C) may arise from the NH proton and its directly bonded carbon in the thiazole-imidazole moiety, though NH correlations in HSQC are often weak or absent due to rapid exchange. A high-field ¹H peak at ~0 ppm (¹H) and ~200 ppm (¹³C) is unusual and may represent an artifact or a minor impurity, as the molecule lacks carbonyl or highly deshielded quaternary carbons. Overall, the spectrum confirms the presence of the morpholine, pyrimidine, thiazole, and sulfoxide functional groups, with chemical shifts aligning with expected electronic effects. The HSQC data provides critical evidence for the connectivity and electronic environment of the heteroatom-rich structure."

The spectrum exhibits several distinct peaks that correlate with the carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak at ~170 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ester group, which is typical for such functional groups due to the strong deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~120 ppm is attributed to the carbon of the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group, which is significantly deshielded by the three fluorine atoms. A peak at ~70 ppm arises from the tertiary carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (C-OH), reflecting its deshielding by the electronegative oxygen. The ester's ethoxy group contributes two peaks: the OCH2 moiety appears at ~60 ppm, and the terminal CH3 group is observed at ~15 ppm, both consistent with their respective chemical environments. The carbon directly bonded to bromine (C-Br) is likely represented by a peak at ~40 ppm, as bromine's moderate electronegativity deshields this sp³-hybridized carbon. The alkene carbons (C=C(Br)) are expected in the 100–150 ppm range; however, their signals may overlap with the CF3 peak or appear as weaker features due to the molecule's symmetry or relaxation effects. The remaining sp³ carbon in the CH2 group adjacent to the alkene and hydroxyl-bearing carbon contributes a peak near ~30–40 ppm, though it may overlap with the C-Br signal. This spectrum highlights the distinct electronic effects of halogens (Br, F), the ester group, and the hydroxyl functionality, which collectively influence the chemical shifts of nearby carbons. The absence of additional peaks suggests minimal structural complexity beyond the described functional groups."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon environments characteristic of an aromatic ketone with substituted phenyl rings and a primary amine side chain. The most prominent peak at approximately 200 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ketone group, which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen atom. This is consistent with the molecular structure, where the ketone bridges two aromatic systems. In the aromatic region (100–150 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the complex substitution pattern on the phenyl rings. The peaks between 130–140 ppm likely correspond to the quaternary carbons adjacent to the ketone and chlorine substituents, which experience deshielding effects from these electron-withdrawing groups. The peaks near 120–130 ppm represent the remaining aromatic carbons, with their splitting patterns and intensities reflecting the asymmetry introduced by the chlorine atom (at the 4-position of one ring) and the amine-linked methylene group (–CH2NH–) on the other ring. A distinct peak at ~50 ppm is attributed to the methylene carbon (–CH2–) directly bonded to the primary amine (–NH2), which is moderately deshielded due to the electronegativity of nitrogen. The methyl group (–CH3) attached to the first phenyl ring appears as a sharp peak near 20 ppm, consistent with its electron-donating inductive effect and lack of significant deshielding. The absence of peaks below 0 ppm or above 220 ppm confirms the absence of highly shielded environments (e.g., aliphatic chains far from electronegative atoms) or additional carbonyl groups. The spectrum’s peak distribution and chemical shifts align with the proposed structure, validating the presence of two distinct aromatic systems, a ketone functionality, and an amine-containing side chain. Integration of peak intensities further supports the 21-carbon framework, with the carbonyl and aromatic regions accounting for the majority of the signal intensity. This C-NMR spectrum provides clear evidence for the molecular architecture described by the given SMILES notation."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C10H11BrO2 (SMILES: Brc1ccc(CC2OCCO2)cc1). The spectrum displays several distinct peaks in the aromatic and aliphatic regions, consistent with the structure of a para-substituted bromobenzene derivative containing a 1,3-dioxolane ring. The most prominent peaks are observed at approximately 10.5 ppm, 8.0 ppm, 6.8 ppm, 6.3 ppm, and 4.2 ppm. The aromatic region (6.3–8.0 ppm) exhibits three peaks, which can be attributed to the four aromatic protons of the benzene ring. The bromine substituent and the electron-donating dioxolane-containing side chain create an asymmetric electronic environment, splitting the aromatic protons into two distinct sets. The peak at 8.0 ppm likely corresponds to the two protons ortho to the bromine atom, which are strongly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of Br. The peaks at 6.8 ppm and 6.3 ppm are assigned to the two protons ortho to the side chain (CH2-dioxolane group), which experience less deshielding. The splitting pattern suggests a para-substitution motif, with coupling between adjacent aromatic protons. The peak at 4.2 ppm is a sharp singlet integrating to two protons, corresponding to the methylene group (CH2) directly attached to the benzene ring. This signal is shifted downfield due to its proximity to both the aromatic system and the adjacent oxygen atoms of the dioxolane ring. The dioxolane ring itself contributes to the aliphatic region, with its two equivalent CH2 groups typically appearing as a singlet or complex multiplet between 3.5–4.5 ppm. However, the observed peak at 4.2 ppm may also overlap with these protons, complicating their resolution. The unusually intense peak at 10.5 ppm is atypical for this structure and may indicate the presence of a minor impurity, solvent resonance (e.g., residual water or formic acid), or an artifact from the measurement conditions. No protons in the target molecule are expected in this extreme downfield region. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, with key features reflecting the aromatic substitution pattern, the deshielded methylene group adjacent to the dioxolane, and the expected splitting of aromatic protons. The anomalous peak at 10.5 ppm warrants further investigation to confirm its origin."

The broad absorption near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the terminal alkyne C-H stretch, consistent with the C#C group in the SMILES structure. A sharp peak at ~2250 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the C≡C triple bond stretching vibration, confirming the presence of the alkyne moiety. The strong band at ~1730 cm⁻¹ arises from the carbonyl (C=O) stretching of the ester group (OC(C)=O), while the adjacent peak at ~1250 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C-O stretching vibration of the same ester functionality. The aliphatic C-H stretching vibrations are evident in the region 2850–2950 cm⁻¹, reflecting the long hydrocarbon chain (CCCCCCCCCC) in the structure. Additional peaks near 1450 cm⁻¹ and 1375 cm⁻¹ are assignable to CH₂ and CH₃ bending modes, respectively. The fingerprint region below 1500 cm⁻¹ contains complex absorptions from C-C skeletal vibrations and the ether linkage (C-O-C) in the cyclic ether ring (OC1...).

The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 417, corresponding to the intact molecule. This peak confirms the molecular weight and aligns with the calculated mass of the formula, accounting for the presence of bromine (Br), which contributes to the characteristic isotope pattern. The molecular ion peak is the base peak (100% relative abundance), indicating high stability of the parent ion under the ionization conditions. Notable fragment peaks are observed at m/z 328, 356, 357, 358, and 159. The cluster at m/z 356, 357, and 358 suggests the presence of a bromine-containing fragment, as the ~1:1 ratio between 356 and 358 reflects the natural abundance of Br-79 and Br-81 isotopes. This fragment likely arises from cleavage of the amide bond in the CON(C)C(=O) moiety, retaining the pyridine ring (Br) and part of the quinoline structure. The peak at m/z 328 may correspond to a loss of a neutral fragment (e.g., CH3OCONH, ~89 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for carbamate or amide derivatives. Lower-m/z peaks at 159, 187, and 216 represent smaller aromatic or heterocyclic fragments. For instance, m/z 159 could derive from the pyridine-bromine substructure (C5H3BrN) or a rearranged quinoline fragment. Peaks at 187 and 216 may involve further degradation of the heterocyclic core, such as loss of methyl or carbonyl groups. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 100 suggests limited aliphatic fragmentation, consistent with the molecule’s rigid aromatic framework. The spectrum’s isotopic signatures and fragmentation pattern provide critical insights into the molecule’s structure, confirming the presence of bromine and validating the proposed SMILES notation. These features are typical of nitrogen- and oxygen-rich heterocycles, where cleavage at functional group junctions (e.g., amide bonds) dominates the mass spectral behavior."

In the aromatic region, ¹H chemical shifts between 6.8–7.8 ppm correlate with ¹³C signals at 110–160 ppm, consistent with the two substituted phenyl rings. The presence of bromine and fluorine substituents on one aromatic ring induces deshielding effects, shifting adjacent proton and carbon resonances downfield. For instance, protons ortho to the fluorine atom (δ ≈ 7.5–7.8 ppm) and their attached carbons (δ ≈ 150–160 ppm) reflect the electron-withdrawing influence of fluorine. In the aliphatic region, methyl groups from the acetyl (COCH₃) and ketone (C(C)=O) moieties exhibit ¹H signals at 2.1–2.5 ppm, correlating with ¹³C resonances at 20–30 ppm. The methylene (CH₂) or methine (CH) groups adjacent to oxygenated carbons, such as the central C(C)O linkage, appear upfield (δH ≈ 3.5–4.5 ppm; δC ≈ 60–80 ppm). Notably, the carbonyl carbons (δC ≈ 190–200 ppm) lack direct ¹H correlations, as expected for quaternary carbons in ketones and esters. The spectrum also highlights the absence of long-range proton-carbon couplings, as HSQC exclusively detects one-bond ¹JCH interactions. This allows precise assignment of protonated carbons, distinguishing between aromatic, aliphatic, and carbonyl environments. The observed chemical shifts align with the molecular framework, confirming the presence of acetyl groups, halogenated aromatic rings, and an ether-linked aliphatic chain. This analysis underscores the utility of HSQC in resolving complex molecular architectures through direct heteronuclear correlation."

The first region, located near 10 ppm in the ¹H dimension and ~120 ppm in the ¹³C dimension, corresponds to aromatic protons and their attached carbons in the phenyl ring (c1ccccc1). These shifts are consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons in an aromatic system, where deshielding effects from the electron-withdrawing amine group (NH₂) on the adjacent quaternary carbon may slightly downfield-shift some resonances. The second cluster of peaks spans 2–4 ppm in the ¹H dimension and 30–60 ppm in the ¹³C dimension, indicative of aliphatic protons and their attached carbons in the cyclohexanone ring (C1CCC(=O)CC1) and the central quaternary carbon’s neighboring environments. The ¹³C shifts in this range suggest sp³-hybridized carbons, with the higher-field signals (~30–40 ppm) likely corresponding to methylene (CH₂) groups in the cyclohexanone ring, while the ~60 ppm region may reflect the carbonyl-adjacent α-carbons. Notably, the absence of peaks near ~210 ppm in the ¹³C dimension confirms the presence of a ketone (C=O) without directly bonded protons, as expected for the cyclohexanone moiety. The lack of correlations in the ¹H 6–8 ppm range suggests limited aromatic proton contributions beyond the phenyl group, and the absence of high-field methyl signals (<1 ppm) aligns with the structure’s lack of terminal methyl groups. This HSQC spectrum thus provides direct evidence for the connectivity of aromatic and aliphatic regions in the molecule, supporting the assigned structure."

The methyl group (CH3) attached to the aromatic ring is observed at ~20 ppm, a typical upfield shift for sp³-hybridized carbons. The morpholinone ring contributes two oxygenated sp³ carbons: one near ~65 ppm (adjacent to oxygen) and another at ~45 ppm (adjacent to nitrogen), both shifted downfield from typical alkyl carbons due to electronegative substituents. A minor peak at ~80 ppm may correspond to the quaternary aromatic carbon bearing the nitrile group, which experiences additional deshielding. The absence of peaks above 220 ppm confirms no additional carbonyl or alkyne functionalities beyond the nitrile and ketone. The spectrum’s resolution and distinct chemical shifts align with the molecular symmetry and functional group diversity of C13H13ClN2O2, providing clear evidence of the proposed structure."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C19H29NO3 (SMILES: CN(C)CC(C)(C)COC1CCCC2Oc3ccccc3OC12). The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing insights into the molecule's structural framework. The ¹H chemical shifts range from ~14 ppm to -2 ppm, while the ¹³C dimension spans ~0–200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm in ¹H, 100–160 ppm in ¹³C):** Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to the six aromatic protons of the benzodioxane moiety (Oc3ccccc3OC12). Each peak reflects a distinct aromatic CH group, with chemical shifts influenced by electron-withdrawing oxygen atoms in the fused ring system. The dispersion of ¹³C shifts (100–160 ppm) indicates varying degrees of deshielding across the aromatic carbons, consistent with the electron-deficient environment near the ether oxygens. 2. **Aliphatic Region (0.5–4 ppm in ¹H, 10–70 ppm in ¹³C):** - **Tert-butyl Group (1–1.5 ppm in ¹H, ~25 ppm in ¹³C):** Three equivalent methyl groups (C(C)(C)) produce a single cross-peak cluster due to their symmetric environment. The low-field ¹³C shift (~25 ppm) confirms their attachment to a quaternary carbon. - **Oxygenated CH₂ Groups (3–4 ppm in ¹H, 60–70 ppm in ¹³C):** Peaks in this range arise from methylene protons adjacent to oxygen atoms, such as the CH₂ group linking the tert-butylamine to the benzodioxane (COC1) and the CH₂ groups in the tetrahydrofuran-like ring (OC1CCCC2). The ¹³C shifts reflect the deshielding effect of electronegative oxygen. - **Aliphatic CH₂/CH Groups (1–2 ppm in ¹H, 20–40 ppm in ¹³C):** These correspond to non-oxygenated methylene and methine protons in the benzodioxane ring (e.g., CH₂ in the tetrahydrofuran ring and CH in the morpholine-like framework). 3. **High-Field Anomaly (~10 ppm in ¹H, ~100 ppm in ¹³C):** A distinct cross-peak at ~10 ppm (¹H) and ~100 ppm (¹³C) suggests a proton attached to a sp²-hybridized carbon in a deshielded environment. This may correspond to a bridgehead proton in the benzodioxane system, where ring strain or anisotropic effects from adjacent oxygens cause unusual downfield shifting. The absence of peaks above 170 ppm in the ¹³C dimension confirms the lack of carbonyl groups, aligning with the molecular formula. Overall, the spectrum highlights the molecule’s structural motifs: a dimethylamino-tert-butyl side chain, oxygenated aliphatic regions, and a benzodioxane aromatic core. The HSQC data effectively maps protonated carbons, validating the connectivity described by the SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays multiple distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in this structurally complex molecule. Key features include: 1. **Carbonyl Region (170–160 ppm):** A sharp peak near 170 ppm corresponds to the amide carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the O=C(Nc1...) moiety. This high-field shift is typical for carbonyl groups in amides due to resonance stabilization. A smaller peak near 160 ppm likely arises from the carbon adjacent to the sulfonamide group (C–SO₂–N), which experiences deshielding from the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group. 2. **Aromatic Region (140–110 ppm):** Multiple peaks in this range reflect aromatic carbons from three distinct systems: - The benzene ring in the tetrahydroquinoline moiety (N1CCCc2cc(Cl)ccc21) exhibits peaks near 140, 130, and 120 ppm. The chlorine substituent (Cl) induces deshielding in adjacent carbons, shifting them downfield (e.g., ~130 ppm). - The benzene ring linked to the sulfonamide (c1ccc(S(=O)(=O)N...)cc1) contributes peaks near 125–115 ppm, with the carbon directly attached to the sulfonyl group appearing at the higher end (~130 ppm). - The thiazole ring (ncs2) shows two peaks near 150–120 ppm, corresponding to its sp²-hybridized carbons adjacent to nitrogen and sulfur. 3. **Aliphatic Region (60–20 ppm):** - A prominent peak near 60 ppm is assigned to the CH₂ group in the CCO side chain, adjacent to the oxygen atom (C–O). - Peaks near 50 ppm and 30 ppm correspond to the aliphatic carbons in the tetrahydroquinoline ring (N1CCCc2...) and the chiral center’s CH₂ group. The carbon bearing the nitrogen (N–CH) appears at ~50 ppm due to deshielding by the electronegative atom. - The terminal CH₂ in the CCO chain resonates near 20 ppm, typical for alkyl carbons with no adjacent electronegative atoms. 4. **Intensity and Symmetry:** The spectrum’s peak intensities vary, with the tallest signals at 120, 130, and 60 ppm, suggesting these environments contain multiple equivalent or nearly equivalent carbons. The absence of overlapping peaks in the aromatic region indicates limited symmetry in the molecule, consistent with the presence of substituents like Cl and the chiral center. This C-NMR spectrum confirms the structural complexity of C22H23ClN4O4S2, with distinct resonances for carbonyl, aromatic, and aliphatic carbons. The chemical shifts align with the functional groups and heteroatom effects predicted by the SMILES notation, validating the proposed molecular framework."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing four distinct cross-peaks that correspond to key structural features of the molecule. The ¹H chemical shifts (x-axis) range from 14 ppm to -2 ppm, while the ¹³C chemical shifts (y-axis) span 200 ppm to 0 ppm. The most downfield ¹H resonance at ~10.5 ppm (¹³C ~120 ppm) corresponds to the aromatic proton adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group (-C(=O)O), which deshields the proton and shifts it to a higher ppm value. This is consistent with the aromatic ring substitution pattern in the SMILES, where the carboxylic acid and bromine atoms create strong deshielding effects. A second aromatic proton appears at ~6.8 ppm (¹³C ~115 ppm), likely representing a proton meta to the bromine substituent, which experiences moderate deshielding due to the halogen’s inductive effects. Two aliphatic cross-peaks are observed. The resonance at ~4.0 ppm (¹³C ~60 ppm) corresponds to the methylene group (-CH₂-) in the ethoxy (-OCH₂CH₃) side chain, where the oxygen atom deshields the protons. The final peak at ~1.3 ppm (¹³C ~15 ppm) represents the terminal methyl group (-CH₃) of the ethoxy chain, which appears upfield due to its saturated nature and distance from electronegative atoms. Notably absent are correlations for the carboxylic acid proton (exchangeable with solvent) and the secondary amine (-NH-) proton, which may be broadened or suppressed in HSQC experiments. The spectrum confirms the presence of one ethyl group (via the CH₂-CH₃ pair) and a substituted aromatic ring with bromine and carboxylic acid functionalities. These observations align with the molecular formula and SMILES structure, validating the connectivity of the protons and carbons in the molecule."

Key spectral features include a cluster of intense peaks in the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm), prominent signals in the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), and minimal intensity in the carbonyl/carboxyl region (160–200 ppm), consistent with the absence of carbonyl functional groups in the provided molecular formula. The aliphatic region exhibits a sharp, high-intensity peak near 50 ppm, likely corresponding to the methylene carbons (CH2) adjacent to the tertiary amine nitrogen in the piperidine ring (CN1CCCCC1). Additional peaks in this region (20–40 ppm) may arise from the remaining piperidine ring carbons and the methylene bridge (COc1...) connecting the ether oxygen to the aromatic system. The aromatic region shows multiple well-resolved peaks between 100–160 ppm, reflecting the presence of multiple aromatic rings: the phenoxy group (c1cccc2...), the pyrimidine ring (ncnc), and the pyridine moiety (c4ccccn4). Notably, a peak near 160 ppm may correspond to the quaternary carbon in the pyrimidine ring or the aromatic carbon bonded to the electronegative chlorine substituent (c(Cl)c3), which deshields the adjacent carbon. The absence of signals above 160 ppm confirms the lack of sp2-hybridized carbonyl carbons, while the moderate-intensity peaks near 100–120 ppm likely represent aromatic carbons in the benzene rings.

The spectrum displays six distinct peaks corresponding to the unique carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak at approximately 170 ppm is attributed to the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (C=O), which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen atoms. Moving upfield, three peaks in the range of 110–130 ppm represent the aromatic carbons of the pyrrole ring. These shifts are consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons in an electron-rich heterocyclic system, with slight variations due to the substituents at positions 1 (N-methyl) and 2 (carboxylic acid). The peak near 40 ppm corresponds to the nitrogen-bound methyl group (N-CH₃), which experiences moderate shielding from the adjacent nitrogen. The most upfield peak at approximately 0 ppm is assigned to the methyl group attached to the pyrrole ring (C-CH₃), which is highly shielded due to its aliphatic nature and lack of direct conjugation with electronegative groups. Notably, the spectrum lacks a seventh peak, suggesting potential overlap of two carbon environments or a minor experimental artifact. The relative intensities of the peaks align with the expected number of equivalent carbons in each environment, though the carboxylic acid carbon exhibits the highest intensity, likely due to its distinct relaxation properties in the NMR experiment. This spectral pattern is consistent with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of a substituted pyrrole core with functional groups at positions 1, 2, and 5."

The spectrum displays a molecular ion peak at m/z 349, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 348 g/mol. The base peak at m/z 205 dominates the spectrum, indicating a highly stable fragment likely formed via cleavage of the molecule’s central quaternary carbon (Cα) adjacent to the carboxylic acid and trifluoromethyl groups. This fragmentation retains the aromatic ring with its methoxy (OCH3) and acetyl (COCH3) substituents, along with a portion of the tert-butyl side chain. Key fragments include a peak at m/z 177, which may arise from further loss of the acetyl group (42 Da) from the base peak, and m/z 191, potentially representing a rearrangement ion involving the aromatic ring and methoxy group. The peak at m/z 91, a common tropylium ion, suggests partial degradation of the aromatic system. Additional peaks at m/z 117, 134, and 147 correspond to smaller aromatic fragments retaining substituents like OCH3 or COCH3. The presence of fluorine atoms is inferred from the absence of significant isotopic patterns (fluorine has a single stable isotope, ¹⁹F), though direct detection of CF3-containing fragments (e.g., CF3+ at m/z 69) is not prominent in this spectrum. The spectrum also shows peaks at m/z 206, 213, and 229, which may result from hydroxyl or carboxyl group rearrangements, while m/z 271 and 243 could indicate partial retention of the side chain.

The spectrum displays distinct carbon environments across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the structural complexity of the compound. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (100–160 ppm):** Multiple peaks in this range correspond to the aromatic carbons of the quinoline and benzene rings. The fluorine substituents (F) on the aromatic ring induce deshielding effects, shifting adjacent carbons to higher ppm values (e.g., ~140–160 ppm). The quaternary carbons at the ring junctions and the carbon adjacent to the lactam carbonyl (c(=O)) also resonate here. 2. **Carbonyl Peaks (160–180 ppm):** A prominent peak near 170 ppm is attributed to the carboxylic acid carbon (C(=O)O), while a slightly lower-shifted peak (~160 ppm) corresponds to the lactam carbonyl (c(=O)).

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C28H27NO4S (SMILES: Cc1oc(-c2ccc(-c3ccccc3)cc2)nc1CCSc1ccc(OC(C)(C)C(=O)O)cc1). The spectrum displays distinct chemical shifts that correlate with the structural features of the compound. The most prominent peak appears near 170 ppm, consistent with a carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (C=O) from the OC(C)(C)C(=O)O group. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~160 ppm likely corresponds to the oxazole ring carbon directly bonded to the oxygen atom (C-O), reflecting deshielding due to the electronegative heteroatom. In the aromatic region (120–140 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the presence of three distinct aromatic systems: the central phenyl ring (c3ccccc3), the biphenyl-linked phenyl group (c2ccc(-c3ccccc3)cc2), and the oxazole ring (c1nc1). The splitting and intensity variations in this region suggest differing electronic environments caused by substituents such as the thioether (-S-) and oxazole nitrogen. A notable peak near 130 ppm may correspond to the carbon adjacent to the sulfur atom in the thioether linkage (-CSSc1ccc...), as sulfur induces moderate downfield shifts. The aliphatic region (0–50 ppm) shows peaks at ~30 ppm and ~20 ppm, assignable to the tert-butyl group (OC(C)(C)) and the methylene bridge (CCS), respectively. The tert-butyl carbons appear upfield due to their saturated, electron-rich nature, while the methylene carbon adjacent to sulfur is slightly deshielded. A minor peak near 10 ppm likely represents the methyl group (Cc1oc...) attached to the oxazole ring. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected chemical shifts for the given structure, with distinct regions corresponding to aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic carbons. The absence of peaks in the 50–100 ppm range indicates no sp3-hybridized carbons bonded to highly electronegative atoms (e.g., alcohols or amines), consistent with the molecular formula. This C-NMR data provides clear evidence for the compound’s structural motifs, including the oxazole core, biphenyl system, and carboxylic acid functional group."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C15H10BrClO2S (SMILES: O=C(O)/C=C/c1ccc(Sc2ccccc2Br)c(Cl)c1). The spectrum displays distinct features characteristic of an aromatic system with halogen and sulfur substituents, as well as a carboxylic acid group. The most prominent peaks are observed in the 10–12 ppm range, which is consistent with deshielded protons in highly electron-withdrawing environments. The broad peak near 11 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton (–COOH), a hallmark of acidic protons that typically appear as singlets in this region due to rapid exchange with trace water or solvent. The multiplet peaks between 10.5 and 12 ppm arise from aromatic protons on the two benzene rings. The ring substituted with chlorine and sulfur (Sc6H4Cl) exhibits protons that are strongly deshielded by the electronegative Cl and the paramagnetic effects of the sulfur atom, leading to downfield shifts. Similarly, the brominated ring (Sc6H4Br) contributes to the aromatic signals, with bromine’s heavy atom effect further splitting and shifting these peaks. The splitting patterns (doublets, triplets) reflect coupling between adjacent aromatic protons, with coupling constants (J values) typical of meta- and para-substituted benzene derivatives. A smaller set of peaks near 7–8 ppm likely corresponds to the trans-olefinic protons of the conjugated alkene (/C=C/). These protons are slightly deshielded due to conjugation with the aromatic rings and the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. Their coupling pattern (doublets with J ≈ 15–17 Hz) confirms the trans configuration of the double bond. The absence of peaks above 12 ppm rules out aldehyde or strongly hydrogen-bonded protons, while the lack of signals below 6 ppm indicates no aliphatic protons are present. The integration of peak areas aligns with the molecular formula, showing 10 aromatic protons (two benzene rings), 1 carboxylic acid proton, and 2 olefinic protons. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the molecule’s conjugated, halogenated aromatic structure and its functional groups."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks corresponding to protons in different chemical environments. The most prominent peak appears near 10 ppm, indicative of a highly deshielded aromatic proton, likely adjacent to electronegative substituents such as chlorine or the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring. Two additional aromatic proton signals are observed around 7.5 ppm and 6.5 ppm, consistent with protons on the substituted benzene ring and the thiazole ring (s1 in SMILES), which are influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of chlorine and the nitrogen-containing heterocycle. A moderate-intensity peak at ~2.5 ppm may correspond to the methylene protons (-CH2-) of the ethyl ester group (CCOC=O), though slightly upfield shifted compared to typical ester CH2 signals (~4 ppm), possibly due to ring current effects or solvent interactions. The absence of broad signals above 12 ppm suggests no free NH or OH protons are detectable under the experimental conditions, likely due to deuteration or rapid exchange. The spectrum confirms the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic protons, aligning with the proposed structure. Integration and splitting patterns would further clarify proton counts and coupling relationships, but the current data supports the assigned molecular framework."

The presence of chlorine is evidenced by the characteristic isotope pattern, though the 37Cl peak at m/z 379 is not distinctly visible, likely due to low relative abundance. Key fragment ions include m/z 316, which may result from the loss of a 61 Da fragment (potentially the NCCO side chain), and m/z 212, suggesting cleavage of the adamantane moiety. Peaks at m/z 135 and 150–154 align with the adamantane-derived fragments, such as the adamantyl cation (C10H15⁺, m/z 135) and its derivatives. The aromatic region shows peaks at m/z 105, 117, and 126, likely arising from the chlorinated benzoyl fragment. Additional peaks at m/z 168, 180, and 182 may correspond to rearrangement ions or fragments retaining the amide linkage. The spectrum reflects the structural complexity of the molecule, with fragmentation pathways dominated by cleavage at the amide bond and the flexible CNCCO side chain, as well as the stability of the adamantane-derived cations.

A significant peak at m/z 182 corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, confirming the molecular weight of 181 g/mol for the neutral compound. The difference of 18 Da between m/z 182 and 164 suggests a facile loss of water (H2O), a common fragmentation pathway for alcohols or molecules with hydroxyl groups, such as the terminal -OH in the OCCNCCOc1ccccc1 structure. Additional notable peaks include m/z 121 and 122, which may arise from cleavage of the ether linkage (C-O-C) or fragmentation of the aromatic ring system. The peak at m/z 77, a characteristic fragment for benzene derivatives, supports the presence of the phenyl group (c1ccccc1) in the molecule. Smaller peaks at m/z 56, 79, 95, and 107 likely correspond to alkyl or heteroatom-containing fragments, such as C4H8 (56), C6H7 (79), or fragments involving the ethylene glycol (-OCH2CH2-) or amine (-NH-) moieties. The peak at m/z 150 may result from a combined loss of 32 Da (e.g., methanol or CH3OH) from the molecular ion.

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups present in the molecule. A broad, moderate-intensity peak near 3400 cm⁻¹ suggests N-H stretching, likely from the secondary amide (lactam) moiety, though its diminished intensity may indicate hydrogen bonding or steric hindrance. Sharp peaks around 2960–2850 cm⁻¹ correspond to aliphatic C-H stretching vibrations from the butyl ether chain (CCCCO-) and cyclopropyl group (CC2CC2). The most prominent feature is the intense, sharp absorption near 1710 cm⁻¹, attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching of the phthalimide group, while a slightly weaker band at ~1680 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the lactam carbonyl. Additional peaks in the 1600–1450 cm⁻¹ region reflect aromatic C=C stretching vibrations from the benzene rings. A distinct band near 1250 cm⁻¹ arises from C-O stretching in the ether linkage, and a weaker absorption at ~1100 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C-N stretching in the imide or lactam.

This fragmentation pattern is characteristic of methoxy-substituted cyclic ketones, where the indanone core (C9H8O) undergoes cleavage adjacent to the carbonyl group. Prominent peaks at m/z 191 and 177 suggest sequential losses of methoxy radicals (31 Da) and smaller neutral fragments (e.g., CH2O, 30 Da). The peak at m/z 148 may arise from further fragmentation of the indanone ring, retaining one methoxy group.

The spectrum reveals correlations between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing insights into the molecular structure. The ¹H chemical shifts span from ~14 ppm to -2 ppm, while the ¹³C shifts range from ~0 ppm to 200 ppm. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm ¹H, 100–160 ppm ¹³C):** Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to protons and carbons in the aromatic systems, including the pyridine ring (c3ccncc32) and the chlorinated/fluorinated benzene ring (cc2cc(Cl)cc(F)c21).

A second prominent peak at ~3.8 ppm, also a singlet, corresponds to the three protons of the methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to position 1. This shift is typical for methoxy protons, which experience deshielding from the electronegative oxygen atom. The third peak, a singlet at ~2.2 ppm, integrates to six protons and arises from the two equivalent methyl groups (-CH3) at positions 3 and 4. Their chemical equivalence and lack of coupling suggest a symmetric arrangement on the aromatic ring, with the electron-donating methyl groups contributing to their relatively upfield shift. The absence of additional peaks confirms the absence of other proton environments, such as NH2 protons, which may either exchange rapidly with solvent (e.g., D2O) or appear as broad signals outside the displayed range. The integration ratios (1:3:6) align with the molecular formula, validating the substitution pattern. Overall, the spectrum reflects a highly substituted aromatic system with distinct electronic effects from functional groups influencing chemical shifts."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 385, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of the compound. The base peak at m/z 297 indicates a highly stable fragment ion, likely formed via cleavage of the amide bond adjacent to the tert-butyl alcohol moiety, resulting in the loss of a C4H9NO fragment (88 Da). Additional significant peaks at m/z 313 and 367 suggest further fragmentation pathways: the former may arise from dehydration of the molecular ion [M+H–H2O]+, while the latter corresponds to the loss of a smaller neutral fragment (e.g., CH3OH or similar). The spectrum also exhibits characteristic peaks at m/z 258, 259, and 268, which may represent fragments retaining the fluorophenyl-substituted oxazole ring system (C10H7FN2O, 190 Da) coupled with partial pyrazole ring structures. Peaks at m/z 122 and 123 are consistent with smaller aromatic fragments, potentially the fluorophenyl group (C7H4F, 111 Da) or oxazole derivatives. The presence of fluorine is indirectly supported by the absence of significant isotope peaks, as fluorine-19 is monoisotopic. Notably, the peak at m/z 296 and 298 may indicate isotopic contributions from nitrogen-containing fragments, given the molecule’s four nitrogen atoms. The overall fragmentation pattern reflects the stability of the oxazole and pyrazole heterocycles, as well as the susceptibility of the amide and hydroxyl groups to cleavage under ionization conditions. This spectrum provides critical insights into the structural features of the molecule, including the connectivity of its aromatic systems and the lability of its functional groups."

The spectrum exhibits a dominant base peak at m/z 245, representing the most abundant ion, alongside a high-mass peak at m/z 273, which corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+ (calculated molecular weight: 272.33 g/mol). The presence of the [M+H]+ peak confirms the molecular formula. Key fragment ions are observed at m/z 227, 231, 202, 163, 150, 129, 111, 107, and 89. The peak at m/z 227 likely arises from the loss of a hydroxyl radical (•OH, 17 Da) from the molecular ion, while the m/z 231 peak may indicate a McLafferty rearrangement or cleavage involving the phosphorus-containing ring. Fragmentation at m/z 202 and 209 suggests homolytic cleavage of the P–O bond in the dioxaphosphole ring, releasing neutral fragments such as butyl radicals (C4H9, 57 Da) or ethoxy groups (C2H5O, 45 Da). Lower-mass peaks at m/z 107, 111, and 129 are consistent with phosphorus-containing ring fragments, such as C3H6PO+ or C4H8PO+ units, stabilized by the P=O group. The peak at m/z 150 may result from a retro-Diels-Alder cleavage of the heterocyclic ring, while m/z 163 could correspond to a butyl-substituted phosphorus oxide fragment. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 273 confirms the molecular weight, and the distribution of fragments aligns with the structural features of the 1,3,2-dioxaphosphole core and its substituents. This spectrum highlights characteristic fragmentation pathways of organophosphorus compounds, including heterocycle opening and alkyl group losses."

    "text": "This is an IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C20H17N3O (SMILES: CCCc1ccc(-c2nc(-c3cccc4ncccc34)no2)cc1). The spectrum displays characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups and structural features of the molecule. The most prominent peaks are observed at approximately 1600 cm⁻¹, 1500 cm⁻¹, 1400 cm⁻¹, and 1000 cm⁻¹, with additional weaker absorptions in the 3000–3500 cm⁻¹ range. The broad, weak absorption near 3400 cm⁻¹ likely corresponds to aromatic C-H stretching vibrations from the benzene and quinoline rings, which typically appear as sharp peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹. The absence of strong, broad peaks in the 3200–3500 cm⁻¹ region suggests no significant N-H or O-H functional groups are present, consistent with the molecular structure. The intense peak at ~1600 cm⁻¹ is attributed to C=N stretching vibrations from the 1,2,4-oxadiazole ring and the quinoline moiety, as well as C=C stretching in the aromatic systems. This region is densely populated due to overlapping contributions from multiple conjugated double bonds. A sharp band at ~1500 cm⁻¹ further supports the presence of aromatic C=C bonds, while the peak at ~1400 cm⁻¹ may arise from C-H bending vibrations in the alkyl (propyl) chain or aromatic rings. The exceptionally strong, sharp absorption at ~1000 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of C-O stretching in the oxadiazole ring, a hallmark of ether-like functionalities. This peak is highly diagnostic for the oxadiazole heterocycle in the molecule. Additional complex absorptions below 1000 cm⁻¹ (fingerprint region) correspond to out-of-plane C-H bending in the aromatic systems and skeletal vibrations of the polycyclic framework. Overall, the IR spectrum aligns with the structural features of C20H17N3O, including aromatic rings, a 1,2,4-oxadiazole ring, and a quinoline group, with no evidence of extraneous functional groups. The spectral data provide clear confirmation of the molecule's conjugated framework and heteroatom-containing rings."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C16H31NO4 (SMILES: CCCCCCCCCCCC(O)CC(=O)NCC(=O)O). The HSQC spectrum provides a two-dimensional correlation between the chemical shifts of directly bonded $^1$H and $^{13}$C nuclei, enabling the identification of protonated carbon environments. The $^1$H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans approximately 14 to -2 ppm, while the $^{13}$C chemical shift axis (y-axis) ranges from 0 to 200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aliphatic Region (1–3 ppm, $^1$H; 20–40 ppm, $^{13}$C):** A cluster of peaks in this region corresponds to the long hydrocarbon chain (C1–C12). The methylene ($-$CH$_2-$) groups in the aliphatic tail exhibit $^1$H shifts near 1.2–1.5 ppm and $^{13}$C shifts around 25–30 ppm, consistent with typical alkyl environments. The uniformity of these peaks reflects the repetitive nature of the chain. 2. **Carbonyl-Adjacent Methylene Groups (2.3–2.5 ppm, $^1$H; 30–40 ppm, $^{13}$C):** Peaks in this region arise from the $-$CH$_2-$ groups directly bonded to carbonyl carbons (e.g., C14 and C16). The deshielding effect of the adjacent C=O groups shifts their $^1$H signals downfield (2.3–2.5 ppm), while their $^{13}$C shifts fall in the 30–40 ppm range, characteristic of carbons alpha to carbonyls. 3. **Hydroxyl-Bearing Carbon (3.5–4.5 ppm, $^1$H; 60–70 ppm, $^{13}$C):** A distinct peak in this region corresponds to the CH group at C13, which bears the hydroxyl ($-$OH) substituent. The $^1$H shift is deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen, while the $^{13}$C shift reflects the sp$^3$ hybridization and substitution pattern. 4. **Amide-Linked Methylene (3.2–3.8 ppm, $^1$H; 40–50 ppm, $^{13}$C):** Peaks in this region are attributed to the $-$CH$_2-$ group (C15) adjacent to the amide nitrogen. The $^1$H shifts are influenced by the proximity to both the nitrogen and the carboxylic acid group, while the $^{13}$C shifts align with typical methylene carbons in similar environments. 5. **Absence of Carbonyl Peaks:** No correlations are observed for the carbonyl carbons (C14, C16) themselves, as these lack directly attached protons, consistent with HSQC’s one-bond ($^1J_{CH}$) selectivity. The spectrum effectively maps the protonated carbons in the molecule, highlighting the structural motifs: a hydrophobic tail, a hydroxyl-bearing center, and polar functional groups (amide, carboxylic acid). These features align with the molecular formula and SMILES notation, confirming the presence of a long-chain hydrocarbon with a hydroxylated amide-carboxylic acid terminus."

The spectrum reveals distinct carbon environments characteristic of the structural features in this compound. The most prominent peak at approximately 200 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the butanoyl group, consistent with its deshielded nature due to the electronegative oxygen. A cluster of signals between 150–160 ppm arises from the carbon bearing the triflate (OSO2CF3) group and adjacent sp2-hybridized carbons in the unsaturated ring, reflecting strong electron-withdrawing effects from the triflate substituent. Peaks in the 120–140 ppm range are attributed to aromatic carbons in the benzyl group (Cc2ccccc2), with multiple resonances indicating non-equivalent environments in the phenyl ring. Additional signals between 50–70 ppm correspond to the methylene carbons (CH2) adjacent to the nitrogen atom in the piperidine-like ring and the benzyl CH2 group, which experience moderate shielding. The aliphatic carbons of the butyl chain (CCCC) appear as lower-intensity peaks below 40 ppm, with the terminal methyl group likely contributing to the peak near 10–15 ppm. The absence of signals above 200 ppm confirms no additional carbonyl groups beyond the ketone, while the lack of peaks in the 90–110 ppm region suggests no sp-hybridized carbons or anomeric centers. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s structural diversity, including aromatic, aliphatic, and heteroatom-substituted carbons. The triflate group’s influence is evident in the high-field shifts of nearby carbons, while the benzyl and butanoyl moieties contribute distinct aliphatic and aromatic signatures. This distribution of chemical shifts aligns with the proposed structure, validating the assignment of functional groups and their electronic effects on carbon shielding."

The spectrum exhibits distinct chemical shifts that correlate with the structural features of the molecule. The most prominent peaks are observed at approximately 2.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, and 12.0–14.0 ppm. The singlet at **2.0 ppm** corresponds to the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the chiral center ([C@H](C)), which is shielded due to its proximity to the amide nitrogen. The **6.0 ppm** singlet likely arises from the NH₂ protons of the carbamoyl group (C(N)=O), though their sharpness suggests restricted rotation or hydrogen bonding in the solid-state environment. The **8.0 ppm** peak is characteristic of aromatic protons on the indole ring (c2cccc3...), particularly those adjacent to the electron-withdrawing amide carbonyl group, which deshields the protons. The **10.0 ppm** singlet is indicative of a highly deshielded proton, possibly the amide NH proton (N–H) of the [C@H](C)N(C=O) moiety, which experiences strong hydrogen bonding or anisotropic effects. The cluster of peaks between **12.0–14.0 ppm** is unusual but consistent with aromatic protons on the ester-substituted benzene ring (COOc1ccc...) and the indole ring, where electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., carbonyls) and ring currents significantly deshield these protons. The spectrum’s complexity in the aromatic region (6.0–14.0 ppm) reflects the molecule’s multiple aromatic systems: the indole ring (c2cccc3...), the benzyl-substituted benzene (Cc4ccc...), and the ester-linked benzene (COOc1ccc...). These protons exhibit splitting patterns typical of substituted aromatic systems, though the exact multiplicity is obscured by overlapping signals. The absence of peaks below 2.0 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic protons beyond the methyl group. Overall, the H-NMR spectrum aligns with the structural features of C27H25N3O4, including its aromaticity, amide functionalities, and ester group, with chemical shifts reflecting the electronic effects of substituents and ring systems."

The fingerprint region below 1500 cm⁻¹ displays complex, overlapping absorptions typical of aromatic and aliphatic bending vibrations. Notably, the absence of a strong, broad absorption near 2500–3300 cm⁻¹ suggests minimal N–H stretching, consistent with the secondary amine (–NH–) in the triazole ring being less acidic and less prone to hydrogen bonding.

The spectrum displays distinct cross-peaks corresponding to proton-bearing carbons, with the ¹H chemical shift (ppm) on the x-axis and the ¹³C chemical shift (ppm) on the y-axis. Key observations include: 1. **Aliphatic region (1–3 ppm, 20–40 ppm):** A cluster of cross-peaks in this region corresponds to the cyclohexyl ring (C1CCCCC1).

The spectrum confirms the presence of the ethyl ester, cyclohexyl ring, and carboxylic acid functionalities in the molecule. The HSQC data aligns with the expected chemical shifts for protons and carbons in these environments, providing a clear mapping of the molecule’s protonated carbons.

The base peak (highest relative abundance) appears at m/z 181, indicating a highly stable fragment. This peak likely arises from the loss of a C3H6O unit (56 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for ketones via α-cleavage adjacent to the carbonyl group. Additional significant peaks at m/z 166 and 167 suggest further fragmentation, possibly involving the aromatic ring system.

This band is typically broad due to hydrogen bonding. A sharp, strong absorption at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid carbonyl group. Additionally, a distinct peak near 1650 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of a lactam (cyclic amide) carbonyl group, as the C=O stretch in amides generally occurs at lower wavenumbers (1630–1690 cm⁻¹) compared to carboxylic acids. Further analysis reveals a series of weaker absorptions in the 1000–1300 cm⁻¹ region, which may arise from C–N stretching vibrations and C–O stretching vibrations of the carboxylic acid. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex, overlapping peaks due to bending vibrations of C–H, N–H (if present), and other skeletal motions of the seven-membered lactam ring and the aliphatic chain. Notably, the absence of a sharp N–H stretching band near 3300–3500 cm⁻¹ suggests the lactam nitrogen is not protonated, aligning with the SMILES notation where the nitrogen is bonded to two carbon atoms.

Key fragment ions include a dominant peak at m/z 196, likely arising from the loss of a CF3 group (69 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for trifluoromethyl-substituted compounds. A smaller peak at m/z 195 may result from further loss of a hydrogen atom or isotopic contributions. Additional significant fragments appear at m/z 157 and 159, separated by 2 Da, consistent with the presence of bromine in the fragment. This suggests cleavage of the cyclopropane ring, yielding a bromophenyl-containing ion (C6H4Br+), where the isotopic pair reflects Br-79 and Br-81. Lower-abundance peaks at m/z 102 and 105 may correspond to smaller aromatic or aliphatic fragments, potentially involving partial decomposition of the cyclopropane ring or benzene ring substituents. The peak at m/z 237 (265 – 28 Da) could indicate loss of a neutral CO or C2H4 unit, while m/z 245 (265 – 20 Da) might reflect HF elimination, though these assignments require further validation. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern underscores the stability of the bromophenyl and trifluoromethyl groups, with the molecular ion retaining significant abundance. The observed peaks collectively support the structural assignment of the compound as a brominated aromatic ring fused to a trifluoromethyl-substituted cyclopropane."

The spectrum displays characteristic peaks corresponding to the proton environments in the benzimidazole, amide, aromatic, and aliphatic regions. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at ~14 ppm, indicative of the benzimidazole N-H proton, which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and aromatic ring current effects. A second singlet at ~10 ppm likely corresponds to the amide N-H proton, also deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl group. In the aromatic region (6–8 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the substituted benzene rings. The benzimidazole ring protons (positions 4, 5, 6, or 7) appear as a multiplet near 7.5–8 ppm, while the aromatic protons on the para-substituted benzene ring (attached to the amide group) resonate at ~7 ppm as a doublet, split by coupling with neighboring protons. The aliphatic region (0–4 ppm) shows several key features. A triplet at ~4 ppm corresponds to the methylene protons (CH2) adjacent to the tertiary nitrogen in the piperidine ring (N4CCC), experiencing deshielding from the electronegative nitrogen. A broad multiplet at ~3 ppm arises from the pyrrolidine ring protons (N5CCCC), while a singlet at ~2 ppm integrates to two methyl groups (C-CH3 on the benzene ring and the pyrrolidine methyl substituent), both in shielded environments. The absence of peaks below 0 ppm confirms no residual solvent (e.g., TMS reference) or highly acidic protons beyond the observed N-H signals. The spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, demonstrating distinct chemical shifts for aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic protons, with coupling patterns consistent with the molecular framework."

The most downfield peak, observed near 200 ppm, is characteristic of the carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the ketone functional group, which is highly deshielded due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atom. Adjacent to this, a peak near 150 ppm likely corresponds to the aromatic carbons in the benzene ring, which are deshielded by the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl group. A cluster of peaks around 100–120 ppm further supports the presence of aromatic carbons, with substitution patterns causing slight shifts in their chemical environments. A prominent peak near 50 ppm is attributed to the carbon bonded to bromine (C-Br), as halogens induce significant deshielding. The aliphatic region (0–50 ppm) shows multiple peaks, including a distinct signal near 40 ppm, which may correspond to the benzylic carbon (the carbon linking the benzene ring to the carbonyl group). The remaining peaks in the 20–30 ppm range arise from the cyclohexyl ring carbons, which exhibit moderate shielding typical of saturated hydrocarbon environments. The absence of peaks below 0 ppm confirms the absence of highly shielded groups like methyl substituents. The spectrum reflects the molecule’s symmetry, with fewer peaks than the total carbon count (14) due to equivalent environments in the cyclohexyl and aromatic rings.

This is accompanied by a significant fragment peak at m/z 321, likely resulting from the loss of ammonia (NH3, 17 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for amines. Additional notable peaks include m/z 322 (potentially an isotopic variant of the molecular ion) and m/z 293, which may arise from cleavage of the propylamine side chain (NCCCN) or loss of a methoxy group (OCH3, 31 Da). The region between m/z 265–280 contains several peaks, including m/z 279 (loss of methyl, CH3, 15 Da) and m/z 280, which could indicate further fragmentation of the aromatic core. Peaks at m/z 294 and 295 suggest isotopic contributions from carbon-13 or nitrogen-15, consistent with the molecular formula.

The base peak (highest relative abundance) at m/z 338 confirms the molecular ion as the most stable species under the ionization conditions. The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the methoxy group (OC), the propylamine linker (NCCCN), and the polycyclic aromatic system. The spectrum demonstrates typical behavior for a nitrogen-rich heterocyclic compound, with facile loss of small neutral molecules (NH3, CH3) and cleavage of aliphatic chains adjacent to aromatic systems.

The most downfield signal appears near 12 ppm, consistent with the aldehyde proton (CHO) in the O=CC group, which typically exhibits deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. Adjacent to this, a multiplet between 8–10 ppm corresponds to aromatic protons from the benzotriazole moiety (n3nnc4ccccc43), where the electron-deficient triazole ring and fused benzene ring create a deshielded environment.

The spectrum displays distinct cross-peaks across the ¹H (0–14 ppm) and ¹³C (0–200 ppm) chemical shift ranges, reflecting the molecule’s structural features. In the ¹H dimension, signals between 10–14 ppm suggest the presence of aromatic or heteroaromatic protons, likely from the pyridone ring (c2ccc(=O)[nH]c2) or the pyrimidine core (S-C-N=C-N). The ¹³C shifts in the 150–200 ppm range correspond to sp²-hybridized carbons in aromatic systems, including the carbonyl carbon of the pyridone (c(=O)) and possibly the thioether-substituted carbon (S-C). Peaks in the 100–150 ppm region likely arise from aromatic carbons in the fluorophenyl group (c(F)cccc(Cl)) and pyrimidine ring, while signals near 50 ppm may correspond to the methylene group (CH₂) in the NCC linker. The spectrum reveals approximately 10–12 cross-peaks, consistent with the molecule’s 18 carbons, many of which are quaternary (e.g., carbons bonded to Cl, F, or N) and thus absent in HSQC. The fluorine substituent on the phenyl ring may induce deshielding effects on adjacent protons and carbons, shifting their signals downfield. Similarly, the chlorine atom likely contributes to electronic asymmetry in the aromatic system, influencing chemical shifts. The thioether (S-CH₃) group may produce a distinct peak near 20–30 ppm in the ¹³C dimension, though its proton signal (S-CH₃) might overlap with other aliphatic regions. Overall, the HSQC spectrum confirms the presence of key functional groups—aromatic rings, a pyridone moiety, a thioether, and an ethylamine linker—and validates the connectivity between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei as described by the SMILES notation.

The most downfield peak at ~180 ppm corresponds to the nitrile carbon (C#N), which is highly deshielded due to the triple bond's electron-withdrawing nature. A prominent peak at ~150 ppm is attributed to the aromatic carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group (-OH) on the benzene ring, as oxygen substitution typically shifts carbon resonances downfield. The peak at ~130 ppm likely represents the central quaternary carbon connecting the isopropenyl group, benzene ring, and pyrimidine ring, which is deshielded by adjacent electronegative atoms and substituents. Three peaks in the 110–125 ppm range correspond to aromatic carbons in the benzene and pyrimidine rings. The benzene ring carbons adjacent to the nitrile and hydroxyl groups exhibit distinct shifts due to their differing electronic environments. The pyrimidine ring carbons, including those near the N-oxide group, contribute to this region as well. A peak at ~80 ppm is assigned to the oxygenated carbon in the pyrimidine ring (likely C2 or C4), influenced by the N-oxide's electron-withdrawing effect.

A significant fragment ion at m/z 450 suggests the loss of ammonia (NH₃, 17 Da) from the molecular ion, likely originating from the secondary amine in the side chain. Another notable fragment at m/z 447 corresponds to the loss of hydrogen fluoride (HF, 20 Da), consistent with the presence of fluorine atoms in the cyclohexanol ring.

In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), three peaks are observed at approximately 7.5, 7.8, and 8.0 ppm. These correspond to the three aromatic protons on the benzene ring, which is substituted symmetrically with bromine atoms at positions 3 and 5 relative to the carbonyl group. The substitution pattern creates two distinct proton environments: the protons at positions 2 and 6 (equivalent due to symmetry) and the proton at position 4. The splitting and chemical shifts arise from spin-spin coupling between these protons and the influence of electron-withdrawing bromine atoms, which deshield adjacent protons and shift their signals downfield. The highest-intensity peak at ~8.0 ppm likely corresponds to the proton at position 4, which is ortho to both bromine atoms, experiencing the strongest deshielding. The peaks at ~7.5 and 7.8 ppm represent the coupled protons at positions 2 and 6, which exhibit splitting patterns due to interactions with the proton at position 4. A fourth signal appears near 3.5 ppm, attributed to the methoxy group (OCH3) attached to the nitrogen atom. This singlet reflects the three equivalent protons of the OCH3 group, which are shielded relative to aromatic protons due to the electron-donating nature of the oxygen atom. The absence of additional signals in the aliphatic region suggests that the N-methyl group (NCH3) either overlaps with the OCH3 signal or is not resolved in this spectrum. The integration of peak intensities aligns with the molecular formula, with the aromatic region accounting for three protons and the aliphatic signal for three protons.

The benzimidazole ring protons (e.g., H-4/H-7) appear in the 7–8 ppm range, with attached carbons resonating at ~120–140 ppm, consistent with sp² hybridization and nitrogen deshielding. A distinct cross-peak near ¹H 3.5–4.5 ppm and ¹³C 50–60 ppm corresponds to the methoxy group (-OCH₃), where the high electron density from oxygen shields the carbon, resulting in a relatively low ¹³C shift.

The spectrum displays correlations between proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) nuclei, revealing key structural features. Two prominent clusters of cross-peaks are observed. The first cluster, located at ¹H shifts of ~11–12 ppm and ¹³C shifts of ~180–190 ppm, corresponds to the carbonyl group of the cyclic ketone. The high ¹³C chemical shift is characteristic of a deshielded sp²-hybridized carbon in a ketone environment, while the downfield ¹H shift suggests protons adjacent to the carbonyl (α-protons), which are deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group. A second cluster of cross-peaks appears in the aromatic region, with ¹H shifts of ~7–8 ppm and ¹³C shifts of ~120–140 ppm. These peaks arise from the protons and carbons of the benzene ring attached to the sulfonyl group. The sulfonyl group (-SO₂-) is electron-withdrawing, causing deshielding of ortho and meta aromatic protons, which explains their downfield shifts. Additional cross-peaks in the aliphatic region (¹H ~1–3 ppm, ¹³C ~20–50 ppm) correspond to the methylene (CH₂) groups in the 12-membered cyclic ketone and the propyl linker between the sulfonyl group and the benzene ring. The sulfonyl-adjacent CH₂ protons exhibit slightly deshielded ¹H shifts (~3–3.5 ppm) due to the inductive effect of the sulfonyl group. The spectrum also shows a sparse distribution of peaks in the region of ~50–70 ppm (¹³C) and ~2–4 ppm (¹H), likely representing the CH₂ groups near the sulfonyl moiety and the cyclic ketone. The absence of peaks in the 0–10 ppm (¹³C) range confirms the lack of quaternary carbons directly bonded to protons. Overall, the HSQC spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the ketone, sulfonyl-linked aromatic ring, and aliphatic chains. The correlations provide critical insights into the connectivity and electronic environment of the molecule’s functional groups."

Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 231 (60%), 169 (40%), and 96 (30%), alongside smaller fragments at m/z 56, 70, 83, 86, 97, 112, 113, 125, 126, 142, 144, 152, 153, 170, and 185. The fragmentation pattern suggests cleavage of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group (C4H8O2, 100 Da), consistent with the peak at m/z 187 (M+ - 100), a hallmark of Boc-protected amines. The m/z 231 peak likely corresponds to a retro-Diels-Alder fragmentation of the morpholine ring system, retaining the N-CH2-CH(OH) moiety. Peaks at m/z 142 and 153 may arise from charge-retained fragments involving the piperidine ring (C6H12N+), while smaller fragments like m/z 56 (C4H8+) and 70 (C4H8N+) suggest alkyl chain cleavage. The absence of a detectable molecular ion (M+ = 286) implies extensive fragmentation under electron ionization, typical for polar, oxygen- and nitrogen-rich molecules. The spectrum reflects the compound’s structural complexity, with fragmentation pathways dominated by heteroatom-directed bond cleavage and stabilization of charged intermediates."

The spectrum displays distinct features characteristic of an aromatic system with electron-withdrawing substituents. The most prominent peak appears as a sharp singlet near 10.5 ppm, corresponding to the highly deshielded proton of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH). This downfield shift arises from the strong electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl group and the acidic nature of the proton. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the complex splitting patterns of the protons on the two substituted benzene rings. The first ring, bearing the carboxylic acid and ketone groups, exhibits a set of multiplets between 7.5–8.2 ppm. These signals correspond to the four aromatic protons on this ring, which experience deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing -COOH and -C(=O)- groups. The second ring, substituted with two chlorine atoms, shows additional multiplets in the same region (7.0–7.8 ppm), assigned to its three aromatic protons. The chlorine substituents induce further deshielding and splitting complexity due to their electronegativity and meta/para-directing effects. The absence of peaks outside the aromatic region confirms the lack of aliphatic protons in the molecule, consistent with the structure. Integration of the signals aligns with the expected proton count: 1H (singlet, -COOH), 4H (multiplets, first ring), and 3H (multiplets, second ring).

Three distinct cross-peaks are observed, reflecting direct ¹H-¹³C couplings. The most downfield proton signal appears near 10 ppm (¹H) and correlates with a carbon at ~140 ppm (¹³C). This peak likely corresponds to an aromatic proton on the benzene ring adjacent to the fluorine substituent, as electron-withdrawing fluorine deshields nearby protons, shifting them downfield. The associated carbon at 140 ppm is consistent with an aromatic carbon bearing an electronegative group (fluorine) and fused to the thiazole ring. A second aromatic correlation is observed at ~7.5 ppm (¹H) and ~130 ppm (¹³C). This peak represents a proton on a less deshielded aromatic carbon, likely positioned meta or para to the fluorine, where the inductive effect is attenuated. The ¹³C shift aligns with typical aromatic carbons in heterocyclic systems. The third cross-peak at ~2 ppm (¹H) and ~25 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methine proton (CH) of the isopropyl group attached to the thiazole nitrogen. The upfield chemical shift reflects the aliphatic nature of this proton, while the carbon shift matches a secondary carbon bonded to nitrogen. Notably absent are correlations for quaternary carbons (e.g., the carbonyl carbon at position 2 of the thiazole ring) or fluorine-bonded carbons, as HSQC only detects protonated carbons. The spectrum confirms the presence of three distinct proton environments: two aromatic and one aliphatic, consistent with the molecular framework. These observations validate the proposed structure, highlighting the utility of HSQC in mapping proton-carbon connectivity in heteroaromatic systems."

The spectrum reflects the molecule’s structural complexity, including aromaticity, heterocyclic components, and halogen substituents. The absence of peaks in certain regions (e.g., aldehyde or ketone carbonyls) confirms the absence of those functional groups. This HSQC data, combined with the provided molecular formula and SMILES, supports the identification of key structural motifs and aids in mapping proton-carbon connectivity for further NMR-based structural analysis."

The most downfield peak, observed near 170 ppm, corresponds to the carbonyl carbon of the ethyl ester group (C=O), characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons in esters. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~150 ppm is attributed to the carbon of the amide group (NC=O), which is slightly upfield due to the electron-donating effect of the adjacent nitrogen.

The upfield shift of the 60 ppm peak suggests its proximity to the sulfur atom, which deshields the carbon through inductive effects. The ethyl ester's methylene carbon (OCH₂CH₃) appears as a distinct resonance near 60 ppm, consistent with oxygen-bound aliphatic carbons. A triplet of peaks near 30–40 ppm corresponds to the tert-butyl group's methyl carbons ((C)(C)C), which exhibit a characteristic upfield shift due to their sp³ hybridization and shielding from the surrounding electron density. The methylene carbon adjacent to sulfur (CSCH₂) is observed near 25 ppm, reflecting the deshielding effect of the sulfur atom. Finally, the thioether carbon (CS) itself appears as a sharp peak near 0 ppm, a hallmark of sulfur-bound sp³ carbons.

The most prominent peak appears at approximately 10.5 ppm as a singlet, corresponding to the aldehyde proton (CHO). This high chemical shift is consistent with the deshielding effect of the electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl group on the adjacent aromatic ring, which further withdraws electron density through resonance and inductive effects. In the aromatic region (7.5–8.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the complex splitting patterns of the protons on the two phenyl rings. The benzaldehyde ring (directly attached to the CHO group) exhibits two sets of doublets, typically observed near 7.8–8.2 ppm, due to the para-substitution pattern. The coupling arises from ortho and meta interactions between the aromatic protons. The second phenyl ring, bearing the CF3 group, shows additional multiplets in the same region (7.5–8.0 ppm). The CF3 group induces significant deshielding of the ortho and para protons on its ring, shifting their signals downfield. The splitting pattern here is influenced by both the CF3 group and the para-linked benzaldehyde moiety, resulting in a combination of doublets and multiplets. Notably, the absence of peaks below 7 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic or non-aromatic protons in the molecule. The integration ratios (not explicitly shown but inferred from peak intensities) align with the molecular structure: 1H for the aldehyde singlet and 8H for the aromatic protons (4H on each phenyl ring). The trifluoromethyl group itself does not contribute to the H-NMR spectrum, as it lacks protons. This spectral data strongly supports the assigned structure, with the aldehyde proton’s distinct chemical shift and the aromatic splitting patterns providing key evidence for the para-substituted biphenyl framework and the presence of the electron-withdrawing CF3 group."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing through-bond connectivity for protons directly attached to carbon atoms. The spectrum displays distinct cross-peaks corresponding to the protonated carbons in the molecule, which can be interpreted in the context of the quinoline-based structure. In the aromatic region (¹H: 6.5–8.5 ppm; ¹³C: 110–140 ppm), multiple cross-peaks are observed. These correspond to the aromatic protons and their attached carbons in the quinoline core and the chlorophenyl substituent. For instance, the quinoline ring protons (e.g., H-5, H-7, and H-8) likely appear as cross-peaks near 7.0–7.8 ppm (¹H) and 120–135 ppm (¹³C), reflecting their deshielded environments due to conjugation and electron-withdrawing effects of the carbonyl group. The chlorophenyl ring protons (H-2', H-3', H-5', H-6') are expected to cluster in a similar region, with slight shifts due to the electron-withdrawing chlorine substituent at position 4'. A prominent cross-peak near 2.3–2.5 ppm (¹H) and 15–20 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methyl group (CH3) at position 2 of the quinoline ring. This signal is characteristic of aliphatic methyl protons attached to sp²-hybridized carbons. Additionally, a cross-peak at ~4.0 ppm (¹H) and ~45 ppm (¹³C) likely arises from the methylene (CH2) group linking the chlorophenyl ring to the quinoline core, reflecting its proximity to both aromatic systems and the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. The hydroxyl proton (OH) at position 4 of the quinoline ring may not exhibit a distinct cross-peak in this HSQC spectrum, as exchange broadening or rapid proton exchange with residual solvent protons can suppress its signal. Similarly, quaternary carbons (e.g., the carbonyl carbon at position 4 and the chlorinated carbon in the phenyl ring) lack directly attached protons and thus do not produce cross-peaks. Overall, the HSQC spectrum effectively maps the protonated carbon framework of the molecule, confirming the presence of aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic components consistent with the assigned structure. The observed chemical shifts align with expected values for a substituted quinoline derivative, with electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, C=O) and conjugated systems influencing the resonance positions. This analysis underscores the utility of HSQC in resolving complex molecular architectures by correlating proton and carbon environments."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C16H23NO3S (SMILES: COC(=O)c1csc(C2CCCN2C2CCOCC2)c1C). The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule's structural features. The most downfield peak, observed near 170 ppm, corresponds to the ester carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the methoxycarbonyl group, a characteristic shift for sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons in carboxylic acid derivatives. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~150 ppm and another at ~130 ppm likely arise from the thiophene ring carbons (C2 and C5 positions), where deshielding occurs due to the electron-withdrawing sulfur atom and aromatic conjugation. A prominent peak at ~60 ppm is assignable to the oxygen-bearing carbon in the morpholine-like CCOCC ring, consistent with the deshielding effect of the adjacent ether oxygen. Additional aliphatic carbons from the pyrrolidine (CCCN) and morpholine rings appear as multiple resonances between 20–40 ppm, reflecting their varying electronic environments. The peak near 10 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (C16) attached to the thiophene ring, which experiences minimal deshielding. The spectrum’s peak distribution aligns with the molecule’s symmetry and functional groups: the ester, thiophene, and heterocyclic rings contribute to the observed chemical shifts. The absence of peaks above 180 ppm confirms no additional carbonyl or highly deshielded carbons are present, while the lack of signals below 0 ppm rules out highly shielded environments like certain organometallic species. This C-NMR data provides direct evidence for the structural motifs in C16H23NO3S, validating the proposed SMILES notation through characteristic carbon chemical shifts and their electronic environments."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C12H13ClN2O2 (SMILES: CC(C)(C)OC(=O)n1ccc2c(Cl)nccc21). The spectrum exhibits distinct features consistent with the structural motifs of this compound. The most prominent peak appears at approximately 3.0 ppm, which corresponds to the nine equivalent protons of the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) attached to the carbamate oxygen. This singlet is slightly downfield shifted compared to typical aliphatic tert-butyl signals (~1.5 ppm), likely due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carbamate carbonyl group. In the aromatic region (6.5–9.0 ppm), three smaller peaks are observed at ~12.0, 11.0, and 10.0 ppm. These high-frequency shifts are characteristic of protons on the electron-deficient heterocyclic rings. The chlorine substituent on the pyridine ring (position 4 in the fused bicyclic system) induces strong deshielding of adjacent protons, particularly those ortho to the Cl atom, explaining the unusually low-field signals. The multiplicity and integration of these peaks suggest a combination of coupling patterns from the fused pyrrole and pyridine rings. The pyrrole-derived ring (with the carbamate-substituted nitrogen) contributes protons with moderate deshielding, while the chlorinated pyridine ring hosts the most downfield-shifted protons. No significant signals are observed in the 4.0–6.5 ppm range, confirming the absence of aliphatic or olefinic protons outside the tert-butyl group and aromatic systems. The absence of broad peaks in the 8.0–10.0 ppm region also indicates no exchangeable protons (e.g., NH or OH) are present, consistent with the fully substituted nitrogen atoms in the structure. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected chemical environment of CC(C)(C)OC(=O)n1ccc2c(Cl)nccc21, where the tert-butyl group dominates the aliphatic region and the fused heterocycles produce highly deshielded aromatic signals influenced by the electronegative chlorine and nitrogen atoms."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 285, corresponding to the intact molecular ion [M]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of the compound. The base peak at m/z 285 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions, typical for aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing substituents like fluorine and nitrile groups. Several fragment ions are observed at lower m/z values, providing insights into the molecule’s structural features. A pair of peaks at m/z 188 and 189 suggests cleavage of the oxadiazole ring (C2N2O), releasing a fragment with a mass of ~97 Da. The peak at m/z 173 may arise from further fragmentation of this oxadiazole-derived species. Notably, the ion at m/z 223 could represent the loss of a nitrile-containing aryl group (C6H2FN2, ~107 Da) from the parent ion, while the adjacent peak at m/z 232 may correspond to a rearrangement or loss of a smaller neutral fragment (e.g., HCN or HF). The cluster of peaks between m/z 258–269, including 258, 268, and 269, likely reflects successive losses of small radicals or molecules, such as fluorine atoms (F•, 19 Da) or hydrogen atoms (H•, 1 Da), from the molecular ion. The peak at m/z 245 might indicate the elimination of a CO molecule (28 Da) from a fragment containing the oxadiazole oxygen. The absence of significant isotopic peaks (e.g., for 13C or 15N) confirms the low natural abundance of heavier isotopes in this system. The observed fragmentation pattern is consistent with the presence of electron-deficient aromatic rings and the oxadiazole heterocycle, which are prone to bond cleavage under electron ionization. These spectral features collectively validate the structural integrity of the molecular formula and its functional groups, including the nitrile, fluorinated aryl rings, and oxadiazole moiety."

The aromatic region (1H 6–8 ppm, 13C 100–160 ppm) exhibits multiple cross-peaks, corresponding to the benzene and heterocyclic rings in the molecule. For instance, peaks near 1H 7.5–8.0 ppm and 13C 120–140 ppm likely arise from protons on the benzothiazole or triazole rings, which are deshielded by adjacent electronegative nitrogen and sulfur atoms. A distinct cross-peak at ~1H 12 ppm and ~13C 160 ppm suggests a highly deshielded proton, possibly on a carbon adjacent to multiple nitrogen atoms in the fused heterocyclic system. In the aliphatic region (1H 0–2 ppm, 13C 20–40 ppm), correlations are observed for the cyclopropane ring (C4CC4 in SMILES), with protons in the upfield region (0.5–1.5 ppm) coupled to carbons at ~25–35 ppm. These shifts are consistent with the strained cyclopropane ring’s unique electronic environment. The lack of peaks in the carbonyl region (13C ~170 ppm) aligns with the absence of directly bonded protons on the amide carbonyl carbon (NC(=O)C4CC4), as HSQC detects only C-H correlations. Overall, the spectrum confirms the presence of aromatic and aliphatic motifs in the molecule, with chemical shifts reflecting the influence of heteroatoms (N, S) and ring strain. The observed correlations support the proposed structure, highlighting the utility of HSQC in mapping proton-carbon connectivity in complex heterocycles."

The most prominent peak at approximately 0 ppm arises from the methyl group (-CH3) of the ethyl ester moiety, which typically appears in the 10–20 ppm range but may shift slightly due to adjacent electronegative oxygen. A high-intensity signal near 50 ppm corresponds to the cyclopropane ring carbons (C1CC1), as strained three-membered rings often exhibit upfield shifts. The aromatic region (100–150 ppm) shows multiple peaks, including a sharp signal near 120 ppm and broader signals between 130–140 ppm, consistent with the substituted benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2). The chlorine substituent deshields adjacent carbons, causing downfield shifts. A distinct peak near 150 ppm likely represents the carbon attached to the hydroxyl group (C(O)c2ccc(Cl)cc2), as hydroxyl-bearing carbons in alcohols typically resonate in the 60–90 ppm range, though conjugation with the aromatic system may shift this value. The carbonyl carbon of the ester (C(=O)O) appears as a sharp signal near 160–170 ppm, though it may overlap with aromatic signals in this region. Additional minor peaks in the 20–40 ppm range could correspond to the methylene (-CH2-) group of the ethyl ester. The spectrum’s resolution and peak distribution align with the molecular symmetry and functional groups in the provided SMILES, confirming the presence of aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic components.

A significant peak at m/z 304 represents the loss of water (H2O, 18 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for carboxylic acid-containing compounds. Additional major peaks at m/z 290 and 272 suggest sequential losses of methanol (CH3OH, 32 Da) and hydrogen iodide (HI, 128 Da), respectively, reflecting the cleavage of the ether (COCC) and C-I bonds in the structure. The base peak at m/z 119, the most intense signal in the spectrum, likely arises from the fragmentation of the aromatic amine side chain, generating a stable benzylamine-derived cation. Peaks at m/z 163 and 177 correspond to fragments retaining the iodine atom, consistent with the high mass contribution of iodine (127 Da) and its characteristic isotopic pattern. The presence of iodine is further supported by the absence of significant isotopic splitting, as iodine is monoisotopic (¹²⁷I). Other notable peaks at m/z 219, 246, and 258 indicate intermediate fragments involving the aromatic ring and carboxylic acid group, such as decarboxylation (loss of CO2, 44 Da) or cleavage of the C-N bond. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern reflects the structural features of the molecule: the ether linkage (COCC), the aromatic ring with an iodine substituent, and the carboxylic acid group.

The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances characteristic of aromatic and heterocyclic environments. The most prominent feature is a sharp, high-intensity peak at approximately 6.0 ppm, which likely corresponds to the thiazole ring proton (C-H) adjacent to the nitrogen atom. Thiazole protons typically appear in the 7.0–8.5 ppm range, but substitution effects from the electron-withdrawing trifluoromethoxy (OCF3) and ester (COOCH3) groups may shift this signal slightly upfield. Additional peaks are observed in the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), including a multiplet near 7.5–8.0 ppm and smaller resonances at ~10.0–12.0 ppm. These signals arise from the two substituted benzene rings. The benzene ring attached to the ester group (COOCH3) exhibits protons deshielded by the electron-withdrawing ester and thiazole substituents, while the ring bearing the OCF3 group shows further deshielding of ortho/para protons due to the strong inductive effect of the trifluoromethoxy group. The peak at ~10.0–12.0 ppm may correspond to protons ortho to the OCF3 group, which experience significant downfield shifts. A minor peak at ~2.0 ppm could represent residual solvent (e.g., chloroform-d at 7.26 ppm, though shifted here) or an impurity, as the molecule lacks aliphatic protons except for the methoxy group (COOCH3), which typically resonates at ~3.5–4.0 ppm but is not clearly resolved in this spectrum. The absence of broad signals in the 10–12 ppm range excludes the presence of acidic protons (e.g., -OH or -NH). The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s conjugated aromatic systems and heterocyclic core, with splitting patterns influenced by the spatial arrangement of substituents. The integration of peak areas would confirm the relative number of protons in each environment, though this data is not visually provided. Overall, the observed chemical shifts align with the structural features of the compound, including aromatic rings, a thiazole moiety, and electron-withdrawing substituents."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across a range of chemical shifts, reflecting the structural complexity of the molecule. Key features include a prominent peak near 160–170 ppm, likely corresponding to carbonyl carbons (C=O) from the amide groups in the structure. These high-field shifts are characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbons in electron-withdrawing environments. Additional peaks between 100–150 ppm suggest aromatic carbons, consistent with the substituted benzene rings in the molecule. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group (CF₃) is inferred from the splitting patterns and chemical shifts in the 110–130 ppm region, as fluorine substituents typically deshield adjacent carbons. A cluster of peaks around 50 ppm indicates aliphatic carbons, likely from the piperazine ring (C2 position in the SMILES notation) and methylene bridges (-CH₂- groups). The absence of signals below 10 ppm confirms the lack of methyl groups directly bonded to electronegative atoms. The spectrum also shows a high-intensity peak near 0 ppm, which may arise from the solvent (e.g., tetramethylsilane, TMS) used as a reference. The chemical shifts and peak multiplicities align with the molecular framework, where the chlorine substituent on the aromatic ring induces deshielding effects on neighboring carbons, shifting their resonances downfield. The symmetry of the molecule is reflected in the limited number of peaks relative to the total carbon count (21 carbons), suggesting overlapping signals for equivalent or nearly equivalent environments.

The presence of peaks at m/z 183 and 196 further supports stepwise degradation of the fused-ring system, potentially involving rearrangements or hydrogen migrations. The peak at m/z 288, while less intense, may indicate the retention of the sulfonamide group with partial fragmentation of the bicyclic framework. Notably, the absence of significant peaks below m/z 150 suggests that the molecule’s stability resists extensive degradation under the ionization conditions used. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, particularly the sulfonamide group and the rigid benzimidazole-tetrahydropyrazine scaffold.

The ¹³C shift of ~60 ppm is characteristic of a methyl carbon bonded to oxygen, while the ¹H shift of ~4.0 ppm aligns with protons in an electron-rich methoxy environment. 3. **Carbonyl and iodine-substituted carbon:** The spectrum lacks peaks in the carbonyl region (¹³C ~160–220 ppm), as expected since the carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the chromone ring does not have directly attached protons and thus does not produce an HSQC signal. Similarly, the iodine-substituted carbon (C-2 in the lactone ring) is not directly bonded to a proton, so it is also absent from the HSQC spectrum. The observed correlations align with the molecular structure, where the methoxy group and aromatic protons dominate the HSQC features. The iodine atom, while present in the structure, does not contribute to the spectrum due to its lack of direct proton-carbon bonding. This spectrum effectively highlights the protonated carbons in the aromatic system and the methoxy group, providing critical connectivity information for structural validation."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances consistent with the molecular structure. The most prominent peak at approximately 175 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH), which is highly deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen atoms. A sharp peak near 0 ppm reflects the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the pyrrole nitrogen, while another methyl group on the pyrrole ring appears around 20 ppm. The aliphatic chain linking the benzene ring to the carboxylic acid contributes two peaks: one near 30 ppm for the methylene carbon adjacent to the benzene ring and another near 40 ppm for the central methylene in the -CH2CH2COOH chain. The aromatic region (100–150 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks, reflecting the substituted pyrrole and benzene rings. The pyrrole ring carbons appear between 110–130 ppm, with distinct shifts for the α- and β-positions relative to the nitrogen. The benzene ring carbons show resonances in the 120–150 ppm range, with deshielding effects at positions ortho and para to the electron-donating nitrogen substituent. The spectrum’s peak multiplicity and chemical shifts align with the expected symmetry and electronic environment of the molecule, confirming the presence of 15 unique carbon environments. This distribution of signals supports the structural assignment and highlights the molecule’s conjugated aromatic systems and functional group diversity."

The spectrum displays characteristic peaks corresponding to the proton environments in the molecule. The most prominent feature is a singlet at approximately 2 ppm, which integrates to 9 protons, consistent with the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) attached to the aromatic ring. This group exhibits a high-field shift due to its electron-donating nature and symmetric environment. In the aromatic region (6.5–8 ppm), multiple peaks are observed. A doublet near 7.2 ppm (integration: 2H) and a triplet near 7.0 ppm (integration: 1H) correspond to the para-substituted benzene ring with the tert-butyl group, reflecting the splitting pattern of a monosubstituted aromatic system. Additional peaks between 7.3–7.5 ppm (integration: 3H) arise from the second aromatic ring, which bears a chlorine atom and a cyclopropyl group. The chlorine substituent deshields adjacent protons, shifting them downfield, while the cyclopropyl group induces further splitting due to its electron-withdrawing effects and ring strain. A broad singlet near 4 ppm (integration: 1H) is attributed to the NH proton of the secondary amine (N-H), which often appears as a variable peak in this region due to hydrogen bonding and exchange effects. Adjacent to this, a triplet at ~2.8 ppm (integration: 2H) corresponds to the methylene group (CH2) directly bonded to the nitrogen (CH2-N), split by coupling with the neighboring CH2 in the ethyl linker. Another triplet at ~2.6 ppm (integration: 2H) represents the terminal CH2 group of the ethyl chain (CH2-CH2-N), coupled to the adjacent CH2-N. A small singlet near 1 ppm (integration: 4H) is consistent with the cyclopropyl ring protons (C3CC3), which typically resonate upfield due to the ring’s electron density and symmetric environment. The absence of significant peaks below 0 ppm or above 8 ppm confirms the absence of aldehyde, carboxylic acid, or highly deshielded protons. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, with distinct chemical shifts and splitting patterns reflecting the molecule’s aromatic, aliphatic, and functional group environments. The integration and coupling constants further support the assignment of proton environments in this substituted amine derivative."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing insights into the molecular structure. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm, ¹H; 100–150 ppm, ¹³C):** Several peaks in this region correspond to protons attached to sp²-hybridized carbons in the purine ring system. The most prominent cross-peaks at ~7.8 ppm (¹H) and ~135 ppm (¹³C) are consistent with H8-C8 correlation in the imidazole ring of the purine core. Additional peaks at ~8.2 ppm (¹H) and ~140 ppm (¹³C) likely arise from H5-C5 in the pyrimidine ring, reflecting deshielding due to the adjacent carbonyl group at C6. 2. **Aliphatic Region (3–4 ppm, ¹H; 40–70 ppm, ¹³C):** Peaks in this region correspond to the side chain (-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH₂OH) attached to N9. The cross-peak at ~3.6 ppm (¹H) and ~62 ppm (¹³C) is attributed to the terminal CH₂OH group, where the carbon is deshielded by the hydroxyl substituent. A peak at ~3.4 ppm (¹H) and ~58 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the CH(OH) carbon, with its proton shifted downfield due to hydrogen bonding or electronegative effects. The CH₂ group adjacent to N9 appears at ~3.2 ppm (¹H) and ~45 ppm (¹³C), reflecting its proximity to the nitrogen atom. 3. **High-Field Aromatic Peak (~11 ppm, ¹H; ~150 ppm, ¹³C):** This unusual downfield shift suggests a proton on a carbon adjacent to strongly electron-withdrawing groups. In this molecule, it likely corresponds to H2′ (or similar notation) in the purine ring, though the exact assignment may require further analysis. The shift could arise from tautomeric effects or hydrogen bonding involving the C2-amino and C6-carbonyl groups. 4. **Absence of Exchangeable Protons:** Protons on heteroatoms (e.g., NH₂, OH) do not appear in HSQC, as expected, since they are not directly bonded to carbon. Overall, the spectrum confirms the presence of the purine core and the hydroxylated side chain, with chemical shifts consistent with the proposed structure.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing the connectivity of protons to their attached carbons. The x-axis represents the ¹H chemical shift (ppm), while the y-axis corresponds to the ¹³C chemical shift (ppm). Key spectral features include: 1. **Carbonyl Region**: A prominent cross-peak is observed near 175 ppm (¹³C) and ~2.5 ppm (¹H), consistent with the carboxylic acid group (C(=O)O). The ¹³C shift aligns with sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons, while the ¹H shift suggests a proton adjacent to the carbonyl (likely the α-CH₂ group). 2. **Oxygenated Carbons**: Peaks in the 50–80 ppm range (¹³C) correlate with protons at 3.0–4.0 ppm (¹H), indicative of the methoxy group (OCH₃) and the ether-linked carbon (C1 in the SMILES notation). The methoxy group typically appears at ~55 ppm (¹³C) and ~3.5 ppm (¹H), while the bridgehead carbon (C1) may resonate at higher ¹³C shifts (~70–80 ppm) due to oxygen substitution. 3. **Alkenyl Region**: Peaks between 120–140 ppm (¹³C) and 5.0–6.0 ppm (¹H) correspond to the olefinic carbons and their attached protons in the C=CC moiety. These shifts are characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbons in a conjugated system. 4. **Aliphatic Region**: Cross-peaks at 20–40 ppm (¹³C) and 1.0–2.5 ppm (¹H) arise from the saturated CH₂ groups in the bicyclic framework (e.g., C2, C3, C5, and C6 in the SMILES structure). The spectrum lacks signals in the aromatic region (150–200 ppm for ¹³C; 6.5–8.0 ppm for ¹H), confirming the absence of aromatic rings, consistent with the provided SMILES structure. Additionally, the carboxylic acid proton (expected ~10–12 ppm in ¹H) is not directly observable in this HSQC experiment, likely due to rapid exchange or relaxation effects. Overall, the HSQC data aligns with the proposed structure, demonstrating correlations for all expected carbon-proton pairs in the bicyclic ether-carboxylic acid framework.

The ¹H dimension (x-axis) spans approximately 14 to -2 ppm, while the ¹³C dimension (y-axis) ranges from 200 to 0 ppm. Notably, the spectrum exhibits three distinct regions of interest: 1. **Aliphatic region (¹H: 0.8–2.5 ppm; ¹³C: 10–30 ppm):** A single cross-peak at ~1.2 ppm (¹H) and ~12 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the terminal methyl group of the ethyl substituent (-CH₂-CH₃) in the SMILES structure. This signal is characteristic of a methyl group adjacent to a methylene unit. Additionally, a peak at ~2.5 ppm (¹H) and ~20 ppm (¹³C) likely arises from the methylene (-CH₂-) group directly attached to the aromatic ring, consistent with its deshielded chemical environment. 2. **Aromatic/olefinic region (¹H: 6.5–8.5 ppm; ¹³C: 100–140 ppm):** This region contains multiple cross-peaks, reflecting the molecule’s extensive aromatic system. The most downfield ¹H signal at ~8.5 ppm correlates with a ¹³C resonance at ~135 ppm, indicative of a proton on a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (e.g., pyridine or triazole ring). Other aromatic protons between 7.0–7.8 ppm show correlations with carbons in the 120–130 ppm range, consistent with substituted benzene and heteroaromatic rings. The pyridine ring in the SMILES structure (c6ncccc6) likely contributes to these signals. 3. **Highly deshielded aromatic carbon (¹³C: ~50 ppm; ¹H: ~4.5 ppm):** A unique cross-peak at ~4.5 ppm (¹H) and ~50 ppm (¹³C) suggests a methylene group (-CH₂-) attached to a nitrogen atom (e.g., the -CH₂- linker in the triazole substituent, nnn(Cc5...)). This chemical shift is typical for benzylic or heteroatom-bound methylene groups. The absence of peaks in the carbonyl region (¹³C: 160–200 ppm) confirms no ketone or carboxylic acid functionalities are present, aligning with the SMILES structure. The HSQC data also highlights the lack of sp²-hybridized quaternary carbons (e.g., ipso carbons in aromatic rings), as these would not produce cross-peaks. The observed correlations provide direct evidence for the ethyl group, benzylic methylene, and multiple aromatic/heteroaromatic rings in the molecule. These features collectively support the structural assignment of C24H19N7 as a polycyclic system with fused triazole, pyridine, and benzene rings."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of the 19 carbon atoms in the structure. Key features include a prominent peak near 200 ppm, characteristic of the ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the bicyclic core. Two intense signals at ~170–175 ppm correspond to the ester carbonyl carbons, one from the methyl ester (COOCH3) and the other from the benzyl ester (COOCH2Ph). Aromatic carbons of the benzyl group appear as a cluster of peaks between 125–135 ppm, with the benzyl methylene carbon (CH2) resonating near 65–70 ppm. The nitrogen-bearing tertiary carbon (N-CH) in the bicyclic system is observed at ~55–60 ppm, while other aliphatic carbons in the cyclohexane and piperidine rings exhibit shifts in the 20–50 ppm range. The high-field region (<30 ppm) includes methyl and methylene carbons with minimal shielding variations. The spectrum’s resolution and peak distribution align with the structural complexity of the molecule, confirming the presence of multiple functional groups and rigid stereochemistry. Notably, the absence of overlapping peaks suggests minimal conformational flexibility, consistent with the bicyclic framework.

This anomaly may arise from trace moisture or an impurity. A broad absorption near 2900 cm⁻¹ corresponds to aliphatic C-H stretching vibrations from the isopropyl group and piperidine ring. The sharp peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of the carbamate moiety, a hallmark of its structure. Additional peaks in the 1600–1450 cm⁻¹ region reflect aromatic C=C stretching vibrations from the pyridine and benzene rings. A distinct band near 1100 cm⁻¹ aligns with C-O stretching in the ether (O-CH₂) and carbamate (C-O-C) linkages. The fingerprint region (<1000 cm⁻¹) displays complex bending vibrations, including potential C-F stretching near 1000–1300 cm⁻¹ due to the fluorine substituent.

Additional significant peaks occur at m/z 164, 148, 120, 121, 132, 149, 190, and 107. The molecular ion (M⁺) is not explicitly observed in the spectrum, suggesting extensive fragmentation under ionization conditions. The base peak at m/z 208 likely corresponds to a stable fragment resulting from the loss of a tert-butyl group (C₄H₉, 57 Da) from the molecular ion, yielding a structure consistent with C₁₀H₁₀NO₄⁺ (calculated mass: 208 Da). This fragmentation aligns with the Boc-protected lactam structure in the SMILES notation, where the tert-butyl ester moiety is prone to cleavage. The peak at m/z 164 may arise from further decarboxylation (loss of CO₂, 44 Da) from the m/z 208 fragment, generating a species with formula C₉H₈NO₃⁺. Peaks at m/z 148 and 149 suggest additional fragmentation of the lactam ring or aromatic system, potentially involving the loss of small neutral molecules like water (H₂O, 18 Da) or methanol (CH₃OH, 32 Da).

In the aromatic region, two prominent peaks at ~7.5 ppm and ~7.0 ppm correspond to the fluorinated phenyl ring and the chloro-substituted indole ring, respectively.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates proton (1H) and carbon (13C) chemical shifts for directly bonded pairs, providing insights into the molecular structure. The spectrum displays three distinct cross-peaks, indicating three unique protonated carbon environments. 1. **Peak at ~1.2 ppm (1H) / ~20 ppm (13C):** This cross-peak corresponds to a methyl group (CH3) attached to a sp3-hybridized carbon. The downfield 13C shift (~20 ppm) is characteristic of a methyl group adjacent to a branched carbon (e.g., isopropyl or tert-butyl environments). In the context of the given SMILES (CC(C)[C@H](C)O), this likely represents the terminal methyl groups of the isopropyl moiety. 2. **Peak at ~1.4 ppm (1H) / ~30 ppm (13C):** This signal arises from a methine proton (CH) bonded to a carbon in a moderately shielded environment. The 13C shift (~30 ppm) suggests a secondary carbon, possibly adjacent to an oxygen-bearing carbon. This aligns with the chiral center in the SMILES notation ([C@H](C)O), where the methine proton is directly bonded to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. 3. **Peak at ~3.6 ppm (1H) / ~70 ppm (13C):** The significantly downfield 1H shift (~3.6 ppm) and 13C shift (~70 ppm) indicate a proton and carbon directly bonded to an electronegative atom, most likely the hydroxyl-bearing carbon (CH-OH). The deshielding effect of the oxygen atom explains the elevated chemical shifts for both nuclei. The absence of additional peaks in the HSQC spectrum implies that the remaining carbons in the molecule are either quaternary (non-protonated) or exchangeable (e.g., hydroxyl protons). The observed data aligns with the structure of (S)-3-methyl-2-butanol (CC(C)[C@H](C)O), where the isopropyl group and hydroxyl-bearing carbon dominate the spectral features. This analysis confirms the connectivity of protonated carbons and highlights the utility of HSQC in elucidating structural motifs in organic molecules."

These shifts are consistent with electron-withdrawing effects from the bromine atom at position 5 and the methoxybenzyl substituent at position 4. A downfield proton signal at δH 8.2 ppm (δC 140 ppm) likely corresponds to the benzimidazole C2-H, deshielded by the adjacent nitrogen atoms. Aliphatic regions show correlations at (δH 4.5 ppm, δC 65 ppm) and (δH 3.8 ppm, δC 55 ppm), assignable to the benzylic CH2 group and the N-methyl group, respectively. The cyclopropyl moiety (C2CC2) produces two distinct cross-peaks near (δH 1.2 ppm, δC 15 ppm) and (δH 0.8 ppm, δC 10 ppm), reflecting the diastereotopic protons and their coupling to sp³-hybridized carbons. Notably, the absence of quaternary carbon signals aligns with the HSQC experiment's design, which selectively detects proton-bearing carbons. The spectrum confirms the molecular framework, including the brominated aromatic system, heterocyclic core, and peripheral aliphatic groups, while providing insights into electronic environments influenced by substituents."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing critical insights into the molecular structure. The spectrum displays three distinct cross-peaks, reflecting the key protonated carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak at approximately 12 ppm (¹H) and 130 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to aromatic protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups. These protons are strongly deshielded due to the proximity of the diketone moiety (C(=O)C(=O)), which withdraws electron density through resonance and inductive effects. The intermediate peak at ~10 ppm (¹H) and ~120 ppm (¹³C) represents aromatic protons in a less deshielded environment, likely on benzene rings substituted with ether linkages (Oc4ccc(OC)cc4). These protons experience moderate shielding from the electron-donating methoxy groups (-OCH₃). Finally, the upfield peak at ~6 ppm (¹H) and ~50 ppm (¹³C) arises from the methoxy groups themselves, where the three equivalent protons of each -OCH₃ group couple to their attached sp³-hybridized carbon. The absence of additional peaks in the spectrum reflects the molecule’s symmetry and the presence of non-protonated carbons (e.g., quaternary aromatic carbons and carbonyl carbons), which do not produce HSQC signals. The observed chemical shifts align with the structural features: aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing diketone and ether substituents, as well as methoxy groups. This HSQC data, combined with the molecular formula and SMILES notation, confirms the presence of a conjugated aromatic framework with distinct electronic environments dictated by functional group interactions."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 310, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 309 Da for the given formula. The base peak (highest relative abundance) appears at m/z 266, suggesting a stable fragment ion formed via loss of 44 Da from the parent ion. This mass difference corresponds to the elimination of CO2, likely originating from the carbamic acid group (-NC(=O)O) in the structure. Additional significant peaks at m/z 239 and 250 indicate further fragmentation pathways. The m/z 239 peak may arise from the loss of a CH2N group (27 Da) from the m/z 266 fragment, while the m/z 250 peak could result from a rearrangement or elimination of a smaller neutral species (e.g., H2O or CH4) from the molecular ion. Lower-intensity peaks at m/z 179 and 165 suggest cleavage of the morpholine ring (N2CCOCC2) or the thiazole ring (sc(NC(=O)O)nc12), with the 14 Da difference between these peaks potentially indicating sequential loss of a CH2 group. The peak at m/z 87 may correspond to a fragment containing the methoxy group (OCH3) or a small heterocyclic substructure. The presence of sulfur in the molecule is consistent with the observed isotope pattern, though the low abundance of M+2 peaks (expected for 34S) suggests limited resolution or natural isotope abundance effects in this spectrum. Overall, the fragmentation pattern supports the structural features of the molecule, including the morpholine, thiazole, and carbamic acid moieties.

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 14 to -2 ppm, reflecting the diverse proton environments in this heterocyclic compound. The most prominent features include a high-intensity singlet at ~12.5 ppm, a strong doublet at ~10.5 ppm, and a cluster of medium-intensity signals between 6.5–8.5 ppm. Additional peaks are observed in the aliphatic region (1.5–3.5 ppm). The singlet at 12.5 ppm corresponds to the lactam NH proton (n21 position), which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl group. The doublet at 10.5 ppm (J ≈ 8.0 Hz) likely arises from the indole-like NH proton (position 1), which is similarly deshielded but split by coupling with a neighboring proton. The aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm) contains multiple signals, including two doublets at ~7.8 ppm and ~7.2 ppm (J ≈ 8.5 Hz) and a multiplet at ~7.5 ppm. These correspond to the fluorinated benzene ring protons, where the fluorine substituent induces strong deshielding and spin-spin coupling, splitting the aromatic signals into characteristic patterns. The doublets at 7.8 and 7.2 ppm likely represent the ortho and meta protons relative to the fluorine, while the multiplet at 7.5 ppm may include overlapping signals from the para proton and other aromatic protons on the fused heterocyclic system. In the aliphatic region, a triplet at ~3.8 ppm (J ≈ 6.5 Hz) and a quartet at ~2.5 ppm (J ≈ 7.0 Hz) suggest methylene groups adjacent to electronegative atoms or unsaturated systems, possibly from the cyclohexene ring (positions 1–4) or the lactam’s α-CH2. Peaks at ~2.0 ppm and ~1.5 ppm correspond to the remaining aliphatic protons on the cyclohexene ring, which exhibit complex splitting due to their proximity to multiple stereocenters. The absence of signals below 1.5 ppm indicates no isolated methyl groups, consistent with the SMILES structure. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, demonstrating key features of aromatic fluorination, lactam and indole-like NH protons, and aliphatic protons in a fused bicyclic system. The chemical shifts and splitting patterns provide critical evidence for the molecule’s structural motifs, including the fluorobenzoyl substituent and the rigid heterocyclic core."

The spectrum displays a molecular ion peak at m/z 517, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. The base peak at m/z 436 suggests a highly stable fragment, likely formed via loss of a trifluoromethyl group (CF3, 69 Da) from the molecular ion. Additional prominent peaks at m/z 424 and 425 may arise from further fragmentation of the CF3-containing moiety or cleavage of the acetylene bridge (C#C) between the thiazole and pyrazolopyrimidine rings.

For instance, m/z 318 could represent a fragment where the pyrazolopyrimidine ring is cleaved, leaving the thiazole-sulfonamide core intact. Peaks at m/z 354 and 378 may originate from partial retention of the trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl ring, with successive losses of fluorine atoms or small hydrocarbon units. Notably, the peak at m/z 393 and its adjacent signals (397, 404) suggest fragmentation pathways involving the heterocyclic framework, potentially through retro-Diels-Alder or radical-induced cleavage. The peak at m/z 490 (M+ – 27 Da) might correspond to loss of a HCN or HF unit, consistent with the presence of nitrogen and fluorine in the structure. The isotopic pattern of peaks at m/z 436 and 437 reflects the natural abundance of sulfur-34 (≈4% intensity relative to sulfur-32), confirming the presence of sulfur atoms in the fragment. Similarly, the spacing between peaks at m/z 500 and 501 aligns with the expected isotopic distribution for fragments containing multiple fluorine atoms. Overall, the spectrum highlights the stability of the sulfonamide and heterocyclic components under ionization, with fragmentation primarily occurring at the acetylene linker and trifluoromethyl substituents.

The most downfield peak at approximately 150 ppm corresponds to the aromatic carbons of the pyrimidine ring (C-2 and C-4), which are deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine substituent and adjacent nitrogen atoms. A peak at ~100 ppm is attributed to the remaining aromatic carbons (C-5 and C-6) in the pyrimidine ring, which experience less deshielding compared to C-2 and C-4. The signal at ~70 ppm arises from the carbon adjacent to the oxygen atom in the morpholine-like bicyclic ring (C-3 in the O-containing ring), where the electronegative oxygen induces moderate deshielding. The peak at ~50 ppm corresponds to the carbon directly bonded to the tertiary nitrogen (C-2 in the N-containing ring), reflecting the deshielding effect of the nitrogen’s lone pair. Finally, the upfield peak at ~30 ppm represents the aliphatic methylene carbons (CH2 groups) in the saturated portion of the bicyclic ring system, which are shielded due to their purely aliphatic environment.

Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (100–160 ppm):** - Multiple peaks between 120–150 ppm correspond to the aromatic carbons of the benzene and pyridine rings. The pyridine ring (Oc2ncc(Cl)cc2Cl) contributes signals near 150 ppm (carbon adjacent to nitrogen and oxygen) and 130–140 ppm (carbons ortho to chlorine substituents). The benzene ring (c1ccc(CCCO)c(Oc2...)c1) exhibits peaks at ~120–135 ppm, with deshielding effects from the electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms and oxygen substituents. 2. **Aliphatic Region (0–60 ppm):** - Peaks at ~60 ppm and 30 ppm are attributed to the terminal CH2OH group and the adjacent CH2 in the CCCO chain, respectively. The isopropoxy group (C(C)O) shows resonances at ~20–25 ppm (methyl groups) and ~70 ppm (methine carbon attached to oxygen), though the latter may overlap with other signals. 3. **Electronegative Substituent Effects:** - Carbons bonded to oxygen (e.g., the benzene-attached OCH(CH3)2 and the pyridine-linked O) appear downfield (higher ppm) due to deshielding. The absence of peaks above 160 ppm confirms no carbonyl or highly conjugated carbons are present. 4. **Chlorine Influence:** - Chlorine substituents on the pyridine ring induce moderate downfield shifts (~130–140 ppm) for adjacent carbons, consistent with their electron-withdrawing inductive effects. The spectrum’s 17 distinct peaks (accounting for symmetry and overlap) align with the 17 carbons in the formula, confirming the molecular structure.

The most downfield resonance appears near 170 ppm, corresponding to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the amide group. This shift is typical for carbonyl carbons in amides, where electron-withdrawing effects from the adjacent nitrogen and oxygen atoms deshield the carbon nucleus. Adjacent to this, a smaller peak near 165 ppm may represent the carbon directly bonded to the sulfur in the thiazole ring (Cc1ccsc1), as sulfur’s electronegativity influences the chemical shift of nearby carbons. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed. The signals between 130–145 ppm correspond to the substituted benzene ring (Cc2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2), where the two chlorine atoms induce deshielding and split the aromatic carbon resonances. The thiazole ring (ccsc1) contributes additional peaks in this region, likely between 120–130 ppm, due to the electron-rich heterocyclic structure and the influence of the sulfur atom. The splitting pattern here reflects the symmetry and substitution of the aromatic systems. The aliphatic region (0–100 ppm) shows several key features. A prominent peak near 60 ppm arises from the methylene carbons (CH2) adjacent to the oxygen in the morpholine ring (CCO1), as oxygen’s electronegativity deshields these carbons. Peaks between 40–55 ppm correspond to the CH2 groups in the N-alkyl chains (NCC1 and CN(Cc2...)), where nitrogen’s inductive effect shifts these carbons downfield. The methyl group (Cc1ccsc1) attached to the thiazole ring appears as a low-intensity peak near 20 ppm, consistent with its aliphatic nature and minimal deshielding. Notably, the spectrum lacks signals above 180 ppm, confirming the absence of carboxylic acid or ketone carbonyls beyond the amide group. The distribution of peaks aligns with the molecular symmetry and functional groups in the SMILES notation, with no unexpected resonances, indicating a pure sample.

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating proton (1H) and carbon (13C) chemical shifts for directly bonded C-H pairs. Key features include: 1. **Methyl Groups**: Peaks in the 1H range of 2.0–2.5 ppm and 13C range of 15–25 ppm correspond to the four methyl (CH3) groups in the structure. These include the three methyl substituents on the benzene ring (positions 1, 3, and 5) and one methyl group on the heterocyclic core (attached to the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine system). Their upfield shifts reflect the electron-donating nature of methyl groups and their aliphatic character. 2. **Aromatic Protons and Carbons**: Multiple cross-peaks in the 1H range of 6.5–8.0 ppm and 13C range of 100–140 ppm arise from aromatic C-H bonds. These include protons on the benzene ring (positions 2, 4, and 6) and heteroaromatic protons in the fused pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine system. The benzene ring protons exhibit moderate downfield shifts (7.0–7.5 ppm) due to aromatic deshielding, while heteroaromatic protons (e.g., in the [nH]c23 ring) appear slightly downfield (7.5–8.0 ppm) owing to the electron-withdrawing effects of adjacent nitrogen atoms. 3. **Des shielded Protons**: A distinct cross-peak near 10.5 ppm (1H) and 130 ppm (13C) likely corresponds to a proton on a carbon adjacent to a nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic system. This high downfield shift reflects strong deshielding from the electronegative nitrogen and potential resonance effects in the conjugated system. 4. **Quaternary Carbons**: The absence of cross-peaks for certain 13C signals (e.g., near 150–160 ppm) indicates quaternary carbons in the aromatic systems, such as the carbon bearing the methyl group in the pyrimidine ring or the ipso carbon of the benzene ring linked to the heterocycle. These carbons lack directly attached protons and thus do not produce HSQC signals. The spectrum’s distribution of peaks aligns with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic components.

The alkyne group (C#C) is evidenced by a 13C signal near 85–90 ppm, with minimal direct 1H correlations due to the absence of attached protons. The spectrum also reveals a cluster of peaks near 2.0–2.5 ppm (1H) and 80–90 ppm (13C), which may correspond to the propargylic carbon (adjacent to the alkyne) and its protons. The absence of correlations in the carbonyl region (13C: 160–220 ppm) confirms the lack of ketone or ester functionalities, consistent with the molecular formula. Overall, the HSQC data aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the molecule’s aliphatic side chains, aromatic rings, hydroxyl group, and alkyne moiety."

The spectrum exhibits a molecular ion peak at m/z 443, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the compound. The base peak at m/z 224 dominates the spectrum, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. This fragment likely arises from cleavage of the ether linkage (O-CH2CH2-O) between the two aromatic rings, generating a benzyl-thiazolidinedione moiety (C12H12NO2S+). The loss of the tert-butyl carbamate group (C5H11NO2, 129 Da) from the molecular ion produces a prominent peak at m/z 314, though the observed peak at m/z 316 suggests additional hydrogen rearrangements during fragmentation. Other notable peaks include m/z 344, which may correspond to the retention of the thiazolidinedione ring with partial aromatic substitution, and m/z 387, potentially resulting from the loss of the tert-butyl group (C4H9, 57 Da) from the molecular ion. The peak at m/z 227 could represent a secondary fragmentation of the thiazolidinedione ring, while m/z 120 and 121 likely correspond to the tert-butyl carbamate fragment (C5H10NO2+). The presence of sulfur in the molecule is reflected in the minor isotopic peaks at m/z values offset by 2 Da (e.g., 445, 226), consistent with the natural abundance of 34S. The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the labile ether linkage, the electron-rich aromatic systems, and the thiazolidinedione ring. The high relative abundance of the m/z 224 fragment underscores the stability of the benzyl-thiazolidinedione cation, a common motif in mass spectrometry of heterocyclic compounds. This spectrum provides critical insights into the compound’s structural integrity and fragmentation pathways, aiding in its identification and characterization."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances consistent with the aromatic and heteroatom-substituted structure of the compound. The most prominent features include a high-intensity peak at approximately 160 ppm, which corresponds to the carboxylic acid carbon (C=O) due to its strong deshielding effect. Additional intense signals are observed in the aromatic region (120–140 ppm), reflecting the multiple sp²-hybridized carbons in the fused benzene and benzothiophene rings. The chemical shifts between 120–130 ppm likely represent carbons directly bonded to sulfur (C–S) or oxygen (C–O) atoms, as these heteroatoms induce significant downfield shifts. A cluster of peaks near 110–120 ppm may correspond to unsubstituted aromatic carbons, while a minor upfield signal around 100 ppm could indicate a carbon adjacent to oxygen in the benzofuran-like moiety. The absence of peaks in the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm) confirms the lack of saturated carbons in the structure. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s rigid, conjugated framework, with each carbon environment contributing to distinct resonance positions. These observations align with the proposed structure, where the carboxylic acid group, aromatic systems, and heteroatoms collectively dictate the NMR chemical shifts."

The spectrum displays characteristic correlations between proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) nuclei, providing insights into the molecular structure. The ¹H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans from -2 ppm to 14 ppm, while the ¹³C axis (y-axis) ranges from 0 ppm to 200 ppm. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic region (6–8 ppm, ¹H; 120–140 ppm, ¹³C):** Multiple cross-peaks correspond to the aromatic protons and carbons of the two benzene rings. The substitution pattern is reflected in the distinct chemical shifts: the protons ortho to the ester group (C=O) appear downfield (~8 ppm), while meta/para protons resonate upfield (~7 ppm). 2. **Aliphatic region (1–3 ppm, ¹H; 20–50 ppm, ¹³C):** Peaks in this region arise from the tert-butyl groups (OC(C)(C)CC(C)(C)) and the ethynyl proton (C#C-H). The tert-butyl methyl protons appear as a cluster near 1.2 ppm (¹H) with corresponding carbons at ~28 ppm (¹³C). The ethynyl proton, a diagnostic feature of the alkyne group, appears at ~3.0 ppm (¹H) with its carbon resonance near 80 ppm (¹³C). 3. **Ester and carbonyl groups:** The carbonyl carbons (C=O) are not directly visible in HSQC (no attached protons), but their influence is seen in the downfield shifts of adjacent aromatic protons. The OCH₂ group of the ester (OCC) appears at ~4.2 ppm (¹H) and ~60 ppm (¹³C). 4. **Quaternary carbons:** The central quaternary carbon (C26) and other non-protonated carbons (e.g., C7, C11) are absent in HSQC, as expected, but their presence is inferred from the molecular structure and complementary techniques like DEPT or HSQC-DEPT. The spectrum confirms the presence of the ethynyl group, aromatic ester linkages, and tert-butyl substituents, consistent with the provided SMILES. The absence of peaks in regions typical for aldehyde (~9–10 ppm, ¹H) or amide groups supports the structural assignment.

The base peak at m/z 230 dominates the spectrum, indicating a significant fragmentation pathway involving the loss of 18 Da (likely H2O), which is characteristic of carboxylic acid-containing compounds. Additional notable peaks include m/z 231 (M+2, potentially due to chlorine isotopic contribution), m/z 166 (loss of 82 Da, possibly a combined loss of CO2 and a methyl group), and m/z 128, which may correspond to a chlorinated pyridine fragment. The presence of chlorine is corroborated by isotope patterns: peaks at m/z 128 and 129 exhibit a ~3:1 intensity ratio, consistent with the natural abundance of 35Cl and 37Cl. Similarly, peaks at m/z 157 and 159, as well as 230 and 231, show analogous isotope distributions. Fragments at m/z 105 and 115 suggest the retention of aromatic or heteroaromatic structures, potentially arising from cleavage of the biaryl bond between the benzene and pyridine rings. The peak at m/z 186 may represent a rearrangement ion or a fragment retaining both the chlorine and carboxylic acid moieties. Lower-abundance peaks (e.g., m/z 214, 215, 216) likely correspond to partial degradation products or minor isotopic contributions.

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule’s complex heterocyclic and functional group composition. Key features include: 1. **Carbonyl Region (160–180 ppm):** A prominent peak near 170 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the β-lactam ring system. Additional peaks in this region may arise from amide carbonyl groups (e.g., the β-lactam C=O and the oxime-linked amide), which typically resonate between 160–175 ppm due to deshielding by electronegative substituents. 2. **Heteroaromatic and Conjugated Systems (120–160 ppm):** Multiple peaks in this range reflect carbons in the thiazole and triazole rings. The thiazole rings (e.g., the 5-amino-2-chlorothiazole moiety) exhibit resonances near 150 ppm for the C–S and C–N adjacent carbons, while the triazole ring (N–N=C–S) contributes peaks around 130–140 ppm. The oxime-linked carbon (/C=N\\O) likely appears near 145 ppm, influenced by conjugation and the electron-withdrawing chlorine substituent. 3. **Aliphatic and Sulfur-Adjacent Carbons (20–60 ppm):** Peaks in this region correspond to the saturated carbons in the bicyclic β-lactam structure (e.g., the C3 and C4 positions in the bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane system) and carbons bonded to sulfur atoms. The resonance near 60 ppm may represent the carbon adjacent to the thioether sulfur (S–C) in the triazole ring, which is deshielded by the sulfur’s electronegativity. 4. **Intensity Distribution:** The relative intensities of peaks align with the number of equivalent carbons in each environment. For example, the carboxylic acid and amide carbonyls (single carbons) exhibit moderate intensity, while aromatic and aliphatic regions show multiple overlapping peaks due to the molecule’s structural complexity. This spectrum highlights the molecule’s diverse electronic environments, with deshielding effects from heteroatoms (Cl, S, N) and conjugation influencing chemical shifts. The β-lactam carbonyl and thiazole/triazole carbons dominate the high-field and mid-field regions, respectively, while aliphatic and sulfur-bound carbons populate the lower-field aliphatic region. These features are consistent with the molecular formula and SMILES notation provided, confirming the presence of multiple functional groups critical to the compound’s bioactivity."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C16H17NO4S (SMILES: O=S1(=O)[C@@H](CCCO)Oc2ccccc2N1c1ccccc1). The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei through one-bond couplings (¹JCH), enabling the assignment of protonated carbons. The spectrum displays distinct clusters of cross-peaks that reflect the molecular structure. In the aromatic region (¹H 6.5–8.0 ppm, ¹³C 110–150 ppm), multiple cross-peaks are observed, consistent with the two phenyl rings in the structure (one from the morpholine-like ring and one from the N-aryl group). The chemical shifts suggest deshielding effects from electronegative substituents, such as the sulfonyl group (-SO₂-) and the oxygen in the morpholine ring. The splitting pattern and peak distribution indicate non-equivalent aromatic protons, likely due to substitution asymmetry in the rings. In the aliphatic region (¹H 1.0–4.5 ppm, ¹³C 20–80 ppm), cross-peaks correspond to the CH₂ groups in the propyl chain (-CCCO-) and the morpholine ring. The most downfield ¹H shifts (~3.5–4.5 ppm) are attributed to protons on carbons adjacent to oxygen (e.g., -OCH₂- in the morpholine ring and terminal -CH₂OH of the propyl chain), while the upfield shifts (~1.0–2.0 ppm) correspond to the central CH₂ groups in the propyl chain. The ¹³C shifts in this region align with typical values for sp³-hybridized carbons bonded to oxygen or sulfur. Notably, the sulfonyl group (-SO₂-) does not produce cross-peaks in HSQC, as it lacks directly bonded protons. However, its presence influences the chemical shifts of nearby carbons and protons through inductive effects. The absence of peaks in the carbonyl region (¹³C ~170–220 ppm) confirms there are no ketone or carboxylic acid groups in the molecule. The spectrum’s resolution and peak dispersion are consistent with a moderately sized organic molecule in solution. The HSQC data, combined with the molecular formula and SMILES notation, confirm the connectivity of the sulfonamide-morpholine scaffold and the presence of two aromatic systems. This analysis provides critical insights into the proton-carbon framework of the compound, aiding in further structural elucidation and assignment of NMR signals."

The spectrum exhibits several key features consistent with the structural components of the molecule. A prominent absorption band near 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of the ester functional group, a characteristic peak for such moieties. The absence of a broad O-H stretch around 2500–3300 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of carboxylic acid functionality, aligning with the ester classification. In the region of 3300–3500 cm⁻¹, a moderate peak is observed, likely attributable to the N-H stretch of the secondary amine embedded in the tetrahydroquinoline-like ring system. This is supported by the molecule's SMILES notation, which includes a nitrogen atom in a saturated ring structure. Aromatic C-H stretching vibrations are evident near 3000–3100 cm⁻¹, consistent with the benzene and pyridine rings in the structure. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays multiple sharp peaks, including those near 1250–1050 cm⁻¹, which may arise from C-O stretching vibrations of the ester group and C-N stretching from the amine. Additional bands around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ correspond to aromatic C=C stretches, further corroborating the presence of conjugated ring systems. The tert-butyl group (CC(C)(C)) in the structure contributes to the aliphatic C-H stretching signals near 2950 cm⁻¹.

The aromatic ring is evidenced by multiple peaks in the 1600–1450 cm⁻¹ region, representing C=C stretching vibrations of the substituted benzene ring. The presence of halogen substituents (Cl and F) is reflected in distinct absorptions: a moderate peak near 1050 cm⁻¹ likely arises from C-F stretching, while the C-Cl bond exhibits a weaker, broader band around 800 cm⁻¹. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), the spectrum shows complex overlapping peaks, including deformations of the cyclopropane ring (C-C-C bending) and C-H bending vibrations from the tert-butyl group (observed near 1370 cm⁻¹). The fluorinated cyclopropane moiety (C3(F)F) contributes to additional C-F stretching absorptions in the 1100–1000 cm⁻¹ range. The absence of broad O-H stretching bands (~3200–3600 cm⁻¹) confirms the lack of hydroxyl groups, aligning with the ester and ether functionalities. Weak peaks near 2950 cm⁻¹ and 2850 cm⁻¹ correspond to C-H stretching of aliphatic groups, including the tert-butyl and cyclopropane C-H bonds.

Additional C-H stretching absorptions are observed in the 2800–3000 cm⁻¹ region, consistent with saturated hydrocarbon components. A prominent band near 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibrations of the two ketone groups in the uracil-derived core. The slight splitting or broadening of this peak may arise from conjugation within the heterocyclic ring system, which can lower the C=O stretching frequency compared to isolated carbonyls. The methoxy group (C-O-CH₃) contributes to a strong absorption near 1000 cm⁻¹, attributed to C-O stretching vibrations. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), multiple peaks are evident, including a distinct band near 1250 cm⁻¹, which may involve C-N stretching or ring deformation modes. The C-Cl bond in the 3-chloropropyl chain typically absorbs in the 550–850 cm⁻¹ range, and a weak-to-moderate peak near 700 cm⁻¹ likely corresponds to this vibration.

The most prominent peak appears near 170 ppm, corresponding to the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (C=O), which is highly deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen atoms. Adjacent to this, a peak at approximately 150 ppm is observed, likely representing the carbon atom in the pyridine ring directly bonded to the chlorine substituent (C-Cl), as halogenated aromatic carbons typically resonate in this region. Additional aromatic carbons in the pyridine ring appear between 120–130 ppm, reflecting their varying electronic environments. In the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm), multiple peaks are evident. A group of resonances around 35–40 ppm corresponds to the methylene carbons (CH2) in the cyclopentane ring, which are slightly deshielded due to their proximity to the carboxylic acid group. A narrower peak near 25 ppm may represent the quaternary carbon of the cyclopentane ring bearing the carboxylic acid substituent, as such carbons often exhibit lower chemical shifts compared to adjacent methylene groups. The absence of peaks below 20 ppm confirms the lack of methyl groups in the structure. The spectrum’s peak distribution aligns with the molecular symmetry and functional groups: 11 distinct carbon environments are observed, consistent with the formula. The pyridine ring contributes four aromatic resonances (including the C-Cl carbon), the cyclopentane ring contributes five aliphatic resonances, and the carboxylic acid contributes one carbonyl resonance. The relative intensities of the peaks reflect the number of equivalent carbons in each environment, with the carbonyl and C-Cl carbons appearing as singular, sharp peaks due to their unique positions. This C-NMR spectrum effectively illustrates the electronic and structural influences of the chlorine substituent, carboxylic acid group, and cyclic frameworks on carbon shielding."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups in this aromatic sulfonyl chloride compound. Key features include a sharp peak at ~3030 cm⁻¹, indicative of aromatic C-H stretching vibrations, and a cluster of peaks between 2920–2850 cm⁻¹, consistent with aliphatic C-H stretching from the methyl group. The intense absorption near 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1500 cm⁻¹ corresponds to C=C stretching in the benzene ring, while the sharp peak at ~1380 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the symmetric S=O stretching of the sulfonyl chloride group. A broader, intense band at ~1180 cm⁻¹ arises from the asymmetric S=O stretching, which is a hallmark of sulfonate or sulfonyl functionalities. The C-O stretching vibration of the methoxy group appears as a moderate peak near 1030 cm⁻¹. Additional aromatic C-H out-of-plane bending vibrations are observed at ~820 cm⁻¹ and ~750 cm⁻¹, suggesting substitution patterns on the benzene ring. The absence of broad O-H or N-H stretches in the 3200–3600 cm⁻¹ region confirms the lack of hydroxyl or amine groups. This spectral profile aligns with the molecular structure, where the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl chloride group and methoxy substituent influence the vibrational frequencies of the aromatic system. The sharpness and intensity of the S=O bands are particularly diagnostic for the presence of the -SO₂Cl moiety in this compound."

The base peak at m/z 256 indicates a highly stable fragment, likely resulting from cleavage of the amide bond in the molecule, releasing the indole-derived fragment (C8H5BrFN4) with a protonated mass of 256. This fragment retains the bromine atom, as evidenced by a minor peak at m/z 257, reflecting the natural isotopic abundance of bromine (Br⁷⁹ and Br⁸¹). Additional bromine-containing fragments are observed at m/z 228 and 229, suggesting further decomposition of the indole moiety, possibly via loss of small neutral molecules like HCN or CO. Other notable peaks include m/z 177, 213, and 240, which may arise from secondary fragmentation of the pyridone ring or indole system. The peak at m/z 109 could correspond to a small aromatic fragment, such as a substituted pyridine or nitrile group. The peak at m/z 336 (366 – 30) suggests loss of a neutral fragment like NO or CH₂F, while m/z 240 might represent the indole fragment minus an oxygen atom. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 366 confirms the molecular ion as the highest mass species. Overall, the spectrum reflects the structural complexity of the molecule, with key fragments aligning with the presence of bromine, fluorine, and heterocyclic components."

The spectrum displays several key features characteristic of this compound. The most prominent peak occurs at m/z 174, which corresponds to a major fragment ion with 100% relative abundance. This fragment likely arises from cleavage of the molecule at the phthalimide moiety (N2C(=O)c3ccccc3C2=O), generating a stable aromatic fragment. A smaller peak at m/z 175, adjacent to the base peak, suggests the presence of a minor isotopic variant, potentially due to natural abundance of ¹³C or ¹⁵N in the fragment. Additional notable peaks include a cluster at m/z 270 (moderate abundance), which may represent a larger fragment retaining parts of the fluorinated biphenyl structure, and a peak at m/z 431 (low abundance), likely corresponding to a near-parent ion resulting from loss of a small neutral fragment (e.g., CH₃OH or CO₂) from the molecular ion. The molecular ion itself appears at m/z 463, confirming the molecular weight of the compound. This peak is consistent with the calculated mass of C26H17F3N2O3 (462.42 g/mol), with the +1 shift likely due to protonation ([M+H]⁺) under the ionization conditions. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 463 indicates minimal dimerization or adduct formation. The low-abundance peaks between m/z 300–400 suggest minor fragmentation pathways involving stepwise loss of fluorine atoms or aromatic ring cleavage. The spectrum’s overall pattern reflects the stability of the phthalimide and fluorinated aromatic systems, which dominate the fragmentation behavior. These features align with the structural motifs in the SMILES notation, particularly the methoxy group (COc1...), trifluorinated aryl rings, and the rigid phthalimide core."

The spectrum displays correlations between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing key structural features of the molecule. In the aromatic region, multiple cross-peaks are observed between 6.5–8.0 ppm (¹H) and 110–140 ppm (¹³C), corresponding to the protonated aromatic carbons of the two benzene rings. These signals are consistent with the electron-rich environment of the hydroxyl-substituted aromatic systems, where deshielding effects from the oxygen atoms shift the carbons downfield. A distinct cluster of peaks appears in the aliphatic region, with ¹H shifts between 2.0–5.0 ppm and ¹³C shifts spanning 30–80 ppm. Notably, a prominent cross-peak near 5.0 ppm (¹H) and 80 ppm (¹³C) likely arises from the carbon adjacent to the fluorine atom ([C@@H](F)), as fluorine’s high electronegativity significantly deshields the bonded carbon. Additional aliphatic correlations in the 2.0–3.5 ppm (¹H) and 30–50 ppm (¹³C) range correspond to the cyclohexane ring protons and carbons, including the [C@H]3C[C@@H](F) segment. The absence of signals in the 0–20 ppm (¹³C) range indicates no methyl groups are present, aligning with the molecular formula. The HSQC data also confirms the presence of oxygenated carbons in the 60–80 ppm range, likely from the ether-linked [C@H]2Oc3 moiety, though these carbons lack directly bonded protons and thus do not produce correlations. Overall, the spectrum provides clear evidence of the molecule’s aromatic and fluorinated aliphatic components, with chemical shifts consistent with the assigned structure."

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands that align with the functional groups present in the molecule. A prominent sharp peak at approximately 1740 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the ester group, consistent with the acetyl (C(C)=O) moiety in the structure. A moderate absorption near 1650 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the C=C stretching vibration of the alkene group, confirming the presence of the vinyl ether (C=C-O) segment. In the region between 1250–1000 cm⁻¹, multiple strong peaks are observed, which arise from C-O stretching vibrations in both the ether (C-O-C) and ester (C-O-C=O) linkages. These bands are typical for oxygen-containing functional groups and reflect the molecule's mixed ether-ester connectivity. The C-H stretching vibrations of the alkyl and alkenyl groups appear as weak to moderate absorptions in the 2900–3000 cm⁻¹ range, with the alkene C-H stretches (sp² hybridized) slightly higher in frequency than the alkyl C-H stretches (sp³ hybridized). Notably, the absence of broad O-H stretching bands in the 3200–3600 cm⁻¹ region confirms the lack of hydroxyl groups, consistent with the molecular formula. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) contains complex, overlapping peaks due to bending and deformation vibrations of the molecular framework, including C-C and C-O-C bending modes. These features collectively support the structural assignment of the molecule as an unsaturated ester with ether functionality. The spectrum’s key absorptions align well with the predicted vibrational modes for C6H10O3 (C=COCCOC(C)=O), providing a clear correlation between the observed spectral data and the molecular structure."

The base peak at m/z 91 represents the tropylium ion (C7H7+), a highly stable aromatic cation derived from the benzyl group (–CH2C6H5) attached to the piperazine ring. This fragmentation is characteristic of compounds containing benzyl substituents. Additional significant peaks include m/z 189, 205, 288, 373, and 393. The peak at m/z 189 likely arises from cleavage of the N–N bond in the triazolopyridazine ring, yielding a benzyl-piperazine fragment (C12H17N2+). The peak at m/z 205 corresponds to the triazolopyridazine-CF2Cl fragment (C5H2F2ClN5+), retaining the halogenated substituent. The peak at m/z 373 (393 – 20) suggests loss of hydrogen fluoride (HF), a common fragmentation pathway for molecules containing fluorine. Further fragmentation of this ion at m/z 373 leads to m/z 288 (373 – 85), consistent with the loss of the CF2Cl group (85 Da). The peak at m/z 120 may originate from rearrangement or further breakdown of the triazolopyridazine ring system. The spectrum reflects the structural complexity of the molecule, with key fragments highlighting the stability of the benzyl-piperazine and triazolopyridazine moieties. The presence of chlorine and fluorine is evident in the fragmentation patterns, particularly in the loss of HF and CF2Cl groups. These features align with the molecular formula and SMILES notation provided, confirming the compound’s identity and structural motifs."

The peak at m/z 242 corresponds to the molecular ion (M⁺), confirming the molecular weight of 242 g/mol as calculated from the given formula. The presence of bromine is evident through the characteristic isotope pattern: a secondary peak at m/z 244 (not explicitly labeled but implied by the bromine isotope ratio of ~1:1 for ⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br) would typically accompany the M⁺ peak, though it may overlap with adjacent signals here. The base peak at m/z 227, the most intense signal, suggests a highly stable fragment resulting from the loss of a neutral moiety (e.g., a 15 Da fragment, likely a methyl group or equivalent, though the structure lacks a methyl substituent, implying a rearrangement or complex fragmentation pathway). Additional significant peaks include m/z 121, 137, and 93, which align with fragments of the benzotriazole core. The peak at m/z 121 likely represents a brominated triazole ring (BrN₃C₂H₂, calculated mass ~121 Da), while m/z 137 may correspond to a larger aromatic fragment retaining part of the fused ring system. Smaller peaks at m/z 93 and 214 suggest further cleavage of the heterocyclic structure, possibly involving loss of CO or other small molecules. The absence of peaks above m/z 242 confirms no higher oligomers or adducts are present. This fragmentation pattern reflects the stability of the brominated heterocycle and the susceptibility of the carboxylic acid group to decarboxylation or other neutral losses. The spectrum provides strong evidence for the proposed structure, with the molecular ion and key fragments corroborating the connectivity in the benzotriazole scaffold."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 14 to -2 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of hydrogen atoms in the molecule. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm):** Two prominent peaks at ~7.2 ppm and ~7.8 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons on the substituted benzene ring (c1ccc(C2CC2)cc1Cl). The splitting pattern suggests a para-substituted system with electron-withdrawing effects from the chlorine atom and cyclopropyl group, causing deshielding of these protons. 2. **Amide and Heterocyclic Protons (8–10 ppm):** A sharp peak at ~8.5 ppm is attributed to the amide proton (N–H) in the C(=O)Nc2 moiety, stabilized by resonance with the adjacent carbonyl group. A smaller peak at ~9.8 ppm may arise from a proton on the pyrazole ring (n1n(C)c2c1), which is deshielded due to the electron-deficient heterocycle. 3. **Aliphatic and Methyl Groups (0–4 ppm):** The most intense peak at ~2.1 ppm corresponds to the two methyl groups (C–CH3) in the molecule, which are shielded and appear as a singlet. Peaks between 1.0–1.8 ppm arise from the cyclohexyl ring (C3CCCCC3) and cyclopropyl group (C2CC2), with the latter contributing a slightly deshielded signal (~0.8–1.2 ppm) due to ring strain. 4. **High-Field Region (<2 ppm):** A broad, low-intensity signal at ~13 ppm is observed, likely representing an exchangeable proton (e.g., residual solvent or trace impurity), as no acidic protons (e.g., –OH, –COOH) are present in the structure. The spectrum’s peak multiplicities and integrations align with the molecular symmetry and substitution patterns. For instance, the cyclohexyl ring’s protons produce overlapping multiplets due to chair conformational dynamics, while the cyclopropyl group’s methine proton appears as a distinct singlet.

A prominent singlet appears at approximately 6.0 ppm with high intensity, while two minor peaks are observed near 10.0 ppm, each with significantly lower intensity. The major peak at 6.0 ppm corresponds to the aromatic protons on the pyridine ring. The electron-withdrawing bromine atom at position 2 and the methoxy (-OCH3) and ester (-COOCH3) groups at positions 4 and 3, respectively, create a deshielded environment for the remaining aromatic protons, shifting their resonance downfield. The splitting pattern suggests these protons are chemically equivalent or experience similar electronic environments, likely due to the symmetry of the substituents on the ring. The two minor peaks at ~10.0 ppm are atypical for this molecular structure, as the SMILES notation does not include aldehyde, hydroxyl, or other highly deshielded proton groups. These signals may arise from trace impurities, solvent residues (e.g., water or formic acid), or minor decomposition products. The absence of peaks in the 3.5–4.5 ppm range, where the methoxy (-OCH3) and ester methyl (-COOCH3) groups would typically resonate, suggests either a limited spectral window in the displayed image or low sensitivity in this region.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) nuclei through one-bond J-couplings, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the molecule. The spectrum displays distinct cross-peaks corresponding to the chemical environments of hydrogen-bearing carbons in the structure. In the aromatic region of the ¹H dimension (6.5–8.0 ppm), multiple cross-peaks are observed, reflecting the protons on the benzene ring (C6H4) and the furan ring (C4H3O). The benzene ring protons, likely appearing as multiplets in this range, correlate with ¹³C shifts between 110–140 ppm, consistent with sp²-hybridized aromatic carbons. The furan ring, a five-membered heteroaromatic system, contributes additional cross-peaks in the ¹H range of 6.0–7.5 ppm and ¹³C shifts near 105–150 ppm, with the oxygen atom inducing deshielding effects on adjacent carbons. A prominent cross-peak near 2.0 ppm (¹H) and ~25 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methyl group (CH3) of the acetyl moiety (COCH3), which is directly bonded to the nitrogen atom. This methyl group exhibits a characteristic upfield shift due to its proximity to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl (C=O) group. Adjacent to this, a cross-peak at ~2.5–3.0 ppm (¹H) and 35–45 ppm (¹³C) likely arises from the methylene (CH2) groups in the ethyl linker (CC) between the benzene and furan rings. These methylene protons are deshielded by the adjacent aromatic systems, resulting in their downfield shift compared to aliphatic CH2 groups. The spectrum lacks cross-peaks in the carbonyl region (160–200 ppm in ¹³C), as the amide carbonyl (C=O) does not bear a directly attached proton and thus is not detected in HSQC. Similarly, quaternary carbons in the aromatic rings (e.g., the ipso carbon of the benzene ring attached to the acetyl group) are absent, as HSQC only detects protonated carbons. Overall, the HSQC spectrum aligns with the expected structure of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(CCc2ccco2)cc1, confirming the presence of aromatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic, and methyl groups through their respective ¹H-¹³C correlations. This analysis provides critical insights into the molecule’s connectivity and electronic environment, supporting its structural elucidation."

The spectrum displays three distinct proton resonances, consistent with the molecular structure. The most prominent peak appears at approximately 4.0 ppm with high intensity, corresponding to the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring. This chemical shift is slightly downfield compared to typical aliphatic methyl groups (typically 2.0–2.5 ppm), indicating deshielding by the adjacent electron-withdrawing chlorine and sulfonyl chloride substituents. Two smaller peaks are observed in the aromatic region at ~10.5 ppm and ~11.0 ppm. These correspond to the two remaining aromatic protons on the benzene ring. The unusually high chemical shifts reflect the strong deshielding effects of the sulfonyl chloride (-SO2Cl) and cyano (-C#N) groups, which withdraw electron density through resonance and inductive effects. The splitting into two distinct peaks suggests non-equivalent proton environments: one proton is likely adjacent to the chlorine substituent (ortho to -Cl), while the other is meta to the sulfonyl chloride group. The absence of additional peaks confirms the lack of other proton-containing functional groups, such as hydroxyl or amine moieties, in the structure. The integration of the peaks aligns with the molecular formula, showing a 3:1:1 ratio for the methyl and two aromatic protons, respectively. The sharpness of all signals indicates minimal coupling, likely due to the rigid aromatic framework and the absence of vicinal protons in the substituted benzene ring. This spectral pattern is characteristic of a highly substituted aromatic system with strong electron-withdrawing groups, which not only deshield nearby protons but also stabilize the molecular framework against conformational flexibility. The data collectively validate the proposed structure, with the H-NMR spectrum serving as a critical tool for confirming the substitution pattern and electronic environment of the molecule."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 263, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 262 g/mol for C18H18N2. The base peak at m/z 131, observed at 100% relative abundance, suggests a highly stable fragment ion, likely arising from cleavage adjacent to the nitrile group or the benzylic position. Additional significant peaks at m/z 91, 103, 116, 118, 132, and 160 provide further structural insights. The peak at m/z 91 is characteristic of the tropylium ion (C7H7+), a common fragment in benzyl derivatives, indicating the presence of a benzyl group in the molecule. The peak at m/z 103 corresponds to a nitrile-containing fragment (C7H5N+), consistent with the aromatic nitrile moiety in the SMILES structure. Peaks at m/z 116 and 118 may result from partial fragmentation of the cyclohexylamine ring system or rearrangements involving the nitrogen atom. The peak at m/z 132, adjacent to the base peak, could represent a secondary fragment with an additional hydrogen or a minor isotopic contribution. The peak at m/z 160 suggests a larger fragment retaining a portion of the aromatic and aliphatic framework. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 263 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity, while the distribution of fragment ions reflects the molecule’s structural features, including the nitrile group, benzyl linkage, and chiral cyclohexylamine moiety. This fragmentation pattern is consistent with the proposed structure and provides critical evidence for its identification."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in this heterocyclic aromatic compound. Key features include a prominent peak near 150–160 ppm, likely corresponding to the electron-deficient aromatic carbons adjacent to nitrogen atoms in the triazole and pyridine rings. These shifts are consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons bonded to electronegative heteroatoms, which deshield the nuclei and induce downfield resonance. Additional peaks in the 120–140 ppm range arise from substituted benzene ring carbons, particularly those bearing chlorine and fluorine substituents, which further modulate chemical shifts through inductive and resonance effects. The most downfield signals (near 150–160 ppm) may also include contributions from the pyridine ring carbon directly bonded to the oxygen atom in the ether linkage (–O–), as oxygen’s electronegativity strongly deshields adjacent carbons. A cluster of peaks around 100–120 ppm likely corresponds to the trifluoromethyl (–CF3) group’s adjacent aromatic carbons, where fluorine’s strong electron-withdrawing effects shift signals downfield. The sharp peak near 50 ppm is characteristic of the methyl group (–CH3) attached to the triazole nitrogen, as aliphatic carbons typically resonate upfield. Notably, the spectrum lacks peaks above 170 ppm, indicating the absence of carbonyl (C=O) or highly deshielded quaternary carbons. The integration of peak intensities aligns with the molecular symmetry, as the triazole core and substituted aromatic rings create distinct carbon environments. Fluorine coupling effects (e.g., splitting patterns) are not explicitly resolved here, suggesting either proton-decoupled acquisition or overlapping signals. Overall, the spectrum confirms the structural motifs of halogenated aromatic systems, a triazole heterocycle, and an ether-linked pyridine moiety, consistent with the provided molecular formula and SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 127, which corresponds to the intact molecular weight of the compound. The base peak (highest relative abundance) is observed at m/z 81, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. Additional significant peaks are present at m/z 109, 82, 79, 69, 57, and 41. The peak at m/z 127 confirms the molecular ion (M⁺), consistent with the molecular formula C7H10O2. The base peak at m/z 81 suggests the loss of a neutral fragment (127 - 81 = 46 Da), likely corresponding to the elimination of a carboxylic acid group (COOH, 45 Da) with an additional hydrogen atom, forming a cyclohexenyl cation (C6H9⁺). This fragmentation is typical for carboxylic acids, where the α-cleavage adjacent to the carbonyl group generates a stable carbocation. The peak at m/z 109 (127 - 18) indicates the loss of water (H₂O), a common fragmentation pathway for carboxylic acids due to the acidic proton in the -OH group. The peak at m/z 82 (127 - 45) may arise from the loss of the COOH group directly, leaving a C6H10 fragment. The m/z 79 peak (81 - 2) could result from further dehydrogenation of the cyclohexenyl cation. Lower-mass peaks at m/z 69, 57, and 41 are characteristic of smaller hydrocarbon fragments derived from the cyclohexene ring. For example, m/z 57 may correspond to a C4H5⁺ ion, while m/z 41 (C3H5⁺) is a common fragment from allylic cleavage in cyclic alkenes. The peak at m/z 69 might represent a C5H9⁺ fragment, formed via ring cleavage. The spectrum reflects the structural features of (S)-cyclohex-3-ene-1-carboxylic acid, where the carboxylic acid group and the unsaturated ring contribute to distinct fragmentation patterns. The stability of the cyclohexenyl cation (m/z 81) dominates the fragmentation, while the molecular ion remains detectable due to the compound’s moderate stability under ionization conditions. These spectral characteristics align with the expected behavior of a cyclic α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid in mass spectrometry."

The most prominent peak, observed near 170 ppm, corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the amide group, which typically appears in this high-field region due to the deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen atom. Additional peaks in the 120–160 ppm range arise from aromatic carbons, including those in the fluorinated pyridine ring (c2ccc(F)cn2) and the benzene ring (c1ccccc1). The fluorine substituent on the pyridine ring induces a downfield shift in adjacent carbons due to its strong electronegativity and inductive effects. A cluster of peaks between 100–130 ppm likely corresponds to the triazole ring carbons (n1nccn1) and other sp²-hybridized carbons in the heterocyclic systems. The methylene group (CH₂) adjacent to the nitrogen in the side chain (CCc1ccn...) resonates around 50–60 ppm, a typical range for aliphatic carbons bonded to electronegative atoms. The methyl group (N-CH₃) appears as a sharp peak near 30–40 ppm, consistent with its shielding in an aliphatic environment. The spectrum also exhibits weaker signals in the 20–50 ppm region, which may correspond to additional aliphatic or sp³-hybridized carbons in the linker regions of the molecule. The absence of peaks below 0 ppm or above 200 ppm confirms the absence of highly deshielded or exotic carbon environments. Overall, the distribution of peaks aligns with the molecular framework, reflecting the presence of aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic components as defined by the SMILES notation. The fluorine atom’s influence on neighboring carbons is evident in the fine splitting and chemical shift deviations within the aromatic regions.

The spectrum displays characteristic peaks across distinct chemical shift regions, reflecting the molecule's structural features. In the downfield region (12–10 ppm), a prominent singlet at ~12.5 ppm corresponds to the acidic NH proton of the tetrazole ring (c3nnn[nH]3), which exhibits strong hydrogen bonding. Adjacent to this, a sharp singlet at ~11.8 ppm likely arises from the NH proton of the secondary amine in the tetrazole moiety, while a weaker signal near ~10.5 ppm may indicate a minor tautomeric form or exchange broadening. The aromatic region (8–6 ppm) shows a complex multiplet between ~7.8–7.2 ppm, integrating to eight protons. This pattern aligns with the two substituted phenyl rings (c1ccc(F)cc1 and c2cc(-c3nnn[nH]3)ccc2), where the fluorine substituent on one ring induces deshielding and splitting (e.g., doublets at ~7.6 and 7.4 ppm due to ortho-coupling).

Adjacent to this, a peak at ~10.5 ppm corresponds to the phenolic hydroxyl proton (Ar-OH), also broadened by exchange effects. The aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm) exhibits multiple distinct peaks, reflecting the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. Specifically, the protons at positions 3, 5, and 6 of the ring appear as a complex multiplet due to the ortho- and para-substituted functional groups, which create anisotropic shielding effects and spin-spin coupling. In the aliphatic region, the ethylene glycol side chain (OCH2CH2OH) produces two prominent signals. The methylene group directly bonded to the aromatic oxygen (OCH2) resonates at ~4.5 ppm as a triplet, while the terminal CH2OH group appears at ~3.5 ppm, also as a triplet, due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. These peaks confirm the presence of the ethoxy linker. Additionally, a minor peak at ~5.5 ppm may arise from the hydroxyl proton of the ethylene glycol moiety, though it is often broad and less distinct in H-NMR spectra. The absence of signals below 3 ppm indicates no additional aliphatic or methyl groups, consistent with the molecular formula. The integration of peak areas aligns with the expected proton count: 1H for COOH, 1H for Ar-OH, 3H for aromatic protons, and 4H for the ethylene glycol chain.

The peak near 150 ppm likely corresponds to the pyrimidine carbon adjacent to the ether oxygen (C1 in the pyrimidine ring), which is also deshielded by the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen atom. Aromatic carbons in the benzene ring appear between 110–140 ppm. The peak at ~130 ppm may represent benzene carbons ortho to the ether oxygen (C2 and C6 in the benzene ring), while the peak at ~110 ppm could correspond to the carbon para to the methoxy group (C4 in the benzene ring), which is shielded by the electron-donating resonance effect of the methoxy substituent. The methoxy carbon (OCH3) itself resonates at ~55 ppm, consistent with typical alkoxy carbon shifts.

Two distinct regions dominate the plot: a cluster of peaks in the aromatic region and correlations in the aliphatic region. In the aromatic region (6–8 ppm, 1H; 110–130 ppm, 13C), multiple cross-peaks correspond to the protons and carbons of the para-substituted benzene ring bearing the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group. The electron-withdrawing CF3 group deshields adjacent aromatic protons, shifting their signals downfield. The symmetry of the para-substituted ring results in two distinct sets of aromatic CH correlations, consistent with the expected splitting pattern. A prominent peak at ~4 ppm (1H) and ~50 ppm (13C) arises from the methine proton and carbon of the chiral center ([C@H]), which is adjacent to the nitrogen of the carbamate group. This carbon is further deshielded by the electronegative nitrogen and the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group. In the aliphatic region, correlations near 1.4–2.5 ppm (1H) and 25–40 ppm (13C) correspond to the protons and carbons of the propyl chain (CCC(=O)O) and the methylene groups adjacent to the aromatic ring. The carboxylic acid (–COOH) and Boc group contribute to the shielding environment of these aliphatic carbons. Notably, a cluster of peaks at 10–12 ppm (1H) and 170–180 ppm (13C) suggests correlations involving highly deshielded protons and carbonyl carbons. While carbonyl carbons typically lack directly attached protons, these signals may arise from exchangeable protons (e.g., the carboxylic acid –OH) or artifacts from long-range couplings. However, HSQC primarily detects one-bond correlations, so these peaks likely represent minor impurities or solvent effects.

The thiophene ring (c2ccsc2) contributes to peaks at m/z 233 and 213, reflecting sulfur-containing fragments. Notably, the peak at m/z 173 may arise from a combination of thiophene and ester-derived fragments. The presence of multiple high-mass fragments (e.g., 343, 361) indicates partial stability of the molecular framework under ionization. Isotopic contributions from sulfur (32S/34S) are not distinctly resolved here, likely due to low abundance of the 34S isotope. Overall, the spectrum reflects a complex fragmentation pathway dominated by ester and ether cleavage, aromatic stability, and thiophene ring participation, consistent with the assigned structure."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C13H16O3 (SMILES: CC(=O)Cc1ccc(C(=O)OC(C)C)cc1). The spectrum exhibits several key features characteristic of this structure. The most prominent peak, observed at m/z 135, corresponds to the base peak and likely arises from cleavage alpha to the acetyl group (CH2COCH3), generating a stabilized acylium ion (C9H9O+). This fragmentation is consistent with the loss of the ester moiety (COOCH(CH3)2, 87 Da) from the molecular ion. The molecular ion itself appears at m/z 221, indicating a protonated molecule ([M+H]+) under soft ionization conditions, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 220.27 g/mol. Additional significant peaks include m/z 179 and 161. The peak at m/z 179 results from the loss of propene (C3H6, 42 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for isopropyl esters. The peak at m/z 161 corresponds to the loss of isopropyl alcohol (C3H7OH, 60 Da), further confirming the ester functionality. Smaller peaks at m/z 91 and 105 are attributed to the tropylium ion (C7H7+) and benzoyl ion (C7H5O+), respectively, both of which are typical fragments in aromatic systems. The spectrum also shows minor peaks at m/z 133 and 143, which may arise from secondary fragmentations involving the acetyl or ester groups. The absence of a strong molecular ion peak (m/z 220) suggests that the ionization method (likely chemical ionization) favors protonation, while the fragmentation pattern reflects the stability of aromatic and carbonyl-containing cations. These spectral features collectively validate the structure of CC(=O)Cc1ccc(C(=O)OC(C)C)cc1, highlighting its acetyl and isopropyl ester substituents on a benzene ring."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C14H22O2 (SMILES: OCCCCCCCCc1ccc(O)cc1). The spectrum displays characteristic peaks corresponding to distinct proton environments in the molecule. The aromatic region (6.5–8 ppm) shows a prominent peak near 7 ppm, consistent with the para-substituted benzene ring. This signal likely represents two sets of equivalent aromatic protons (H-2, H-6 and H-3, H-5) split by the para-hydroxyl group and the aliphatic chain, producing doublets with moderate coupling constants. The hydroxyl proton on the benzene ring (phenolic -OH) may appear as a broad singlet near 5–6 ppm, though it is not distinctly visible here, possibly due to exchange broadening or overlap with other signals. In the aliphatic region, a peak near 3.5–4 ppm corresponds to the methylene protons (CH2) adjacent to the terminal hydroxyl group (-OCH2-), which are deshielded by the electronegative oxygen. A signal near 2.5 ppm is attributed to the methylene group directly attached to the benzene ring (-CH2-Ph), influenced by the aromatic ring’s electron-withdrawing effects. The long aliphatic chain (-(CH2)6-) generates overlapping multiplets between 1–2 ppm, typical for saturated hydrocarbon chains. These peaks reflect the uniform chemical environment of the middle methylene groups, with slight variations due to proximity to the chain ends. The absence of signals below 1 ppm suggests no significant branching or methyl groups in the structure. The overall peak intensities align with the molecular symmetry, with the aromatic and OCH2 regions showing higher intensity due to their distinct environments. This spectrum confirms the presence of a linear aliphatic chain linked to a para-substituted phenolic ring, consistent with the provided molecular formula and SMILES notation."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C13H15N5O (SMILES: Nc1nnc(N2CCOCC2)c(-c2ccccc2)n1). The spectrum displays key correlations between proton (1H) and carbon (13C) chemical shifts, providing insights into the molecular structure. Two distinct cross-peaks are observed in the aromatic region: one at approximately 7.5 ppm (1H) and 120 ppm (13C), and another at ~10.5 ppm (1H) and ~120 ppm (13C). These peaks correspond to protons attached to sp²-hybridized carbons in the phenyl ring and potentially a deshielded proton on the triazine core. The phenyl group’s aromatic protons typically resonate between 7–8 ppm in the 1H dimension, while their attached carbons appear near 120–130 ppm in the 13C dimension, consistent with the observed correlations. The upfield shift of the 10.5 ppm proton suggests strong deshielding, likely due to its proximity to electronegative nitrogen atoms in the triazine ring. Additionally, a cross-peak at ~7.5 ppm (1H) and ~50 ppm (13C) is visible, indicative of protons on a carbon adjacent to the morpholine nitrogen. The morpholine ring’s CH₂ groups typically exhibit 1H shifts of 2.5–4.0 ppm and 13C shifts of 50–65 ppm, depending on their position relative to oxygen and nitrogen. This peak likely arises from the CH₂ group directly bonded to the triazine nitrogen, experiencing moderate deshielding. The absence of peaks in the aliphatic region (e.g., below 5 ppm in 1H) suggests no isolated alkyl protons are present. The HSQC data confirm the connectivity of the phenyl and morpholine substituents to the triazine core, with the observed chemical shifts reflecting the electronic effects of adjacent heteroatoms. The spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, validating the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic motifs in the molecule."

The methoxy group appears as a sharp singlet near 3.8 ppm, integrating to 3 protons. Two multiplets at ~3.6–3.7 ppm and ~3.4–3.5 ppm represent the diastereotopic methylene (CH2) protons of the ethylene glycol ether chains attached to the phosphorus atom, with their chemical shifts influenced by oxygen deshielding effects. A broad resonance near 4.5 ppm, integrating to two protons, is assignable to the hydroxyl (OH) groups of the ethylene glycol moieties, likely exhibiting hydrogen bonding. The phosphorus-bound methylene protons (CH2P) appear as a doublet near 2.9 ppm due to ³JPH coupling, though this region may overlap with other aliphatic signals. The absence of peaks above 10 ppm indicates no strongly acidic protons (e.g., carboxylic acids), and the lack of signals below 2 ppm suggests minimal aliphatic chain content beyond the ethylene glycol segments. The integration ratios and splitting patterns align with the molecular formula, confirming the presence of one aromatic ring, two ethylene glycol chains, a methoxy group, and a phosphonate moiety. The spectrum reflects the molecule’s polar, hydrophilic character due to multiple oxygen and nitrogen functionalities."

A broad, intense peak centered near 3300 cm⁻¹ indicates O–H stretching vibrations from the three hydroxyl groups in the ribose moiety, consistent with hydrogen-bonded alcohols. Sharp peaks between 2900–3000 cm⁻¹ arise from C–H stretching in the ribose ring and exocyclic CH₂ group. The prominent absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration in the purine-derived heterocycle. Additional peaks in the 1000–1200 cm⁻¹ region reflect C–O and C–C stretching vibrations in the sugar ring and glycosidic bond, with the strongest band near 1050 cm⁻¹ typical of C–O–C asymmetric stretching in furanose rings. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex, overlapping bands from bending and deformation modes of the aromatic C–H, N–H, and C–N bonds in the triazolopyrimidine core. The absence of strong absorption above 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests minimal free water content, while the lack of distinct N–H peaks above 3100 cm⁻¹ implies intramolecular hydrogen bonding involving the triazole and pyrimidine nitrogens.

The base peak at m/z 126 suggests a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the ether linkage (O–C bond) between the cyclobutane ring and the aromatic moiety, retaining the chlorinated phenyl group and a portion of the cyclobutane structure. Additional significant peaks include m/z 262, which corresponds to the molecular ion minus ammonia (NH3, 17 Da), indicating the loss of the primary amine group from the cyclobutane ring. Peaks at m/z 168 and 154 may result from further fragmentation of the aromatic ether fragment, with m/z 154 representing a loss of a methyl group (14 Da) from m/z 168.

The most downfield peak at ~14 ppm (¹H) and ~190 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the aldehyde proton and carbonyl carbon, a hallmark of the formyl group (-CHO) in the structure. This shift is characteristic of the deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen in the carbonyl group. Three additional peaks in the aromatic region reflect protons attached to sp²-hybridized carbons of the benzene ring. The peak at ~10 ppm (¹H) and ~120 ppm (¹³C) likely arises from a proton ortho to both the aldehyde and chlorine substituents, experiencing strong deshielding due to the combined electron-withdrawing effects of these groups. The two remaining peaks (~7.5 ppm/130 ppm and ~7 ppm/125 ppm) correspond to protons on the remaining aromatic carbons, with shifts influenced by the chlorine atom and the electron-donating oxygen atoms of the fused 1,3-benzodioxane ring (OCCCO bridge). The chlorine substituent induces deshielding in adjacent protons, while the oxygen atoms in the dioxane ring contribute to shielding variations in the aromatic system. Notably, the spectrum lacks correlations in the aliphatic region (0–4 ppm for ¹H, 10–70 ppm for ¹³C), indicating that the methylene protons (-CH₂-) in the OCCCO chain are either not resolved or exhibit rapid relaxation, which is common for flexible aliphatic segments in HSQC experiments. The observed peaks align with the expected substitution pattern of the benzene ring, where the chlorine, aldehyde, and dioxane ring create distinct electronic environments for the three aromatic protons. This analysis confirms the structural features of the molecule, including the presence of a conjugated aldehyde, halogenated aromatic system, and a fused oxygen-containing heterocycle."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption bands corresponding to key functional groups in the structure. A broad, intense peak near 3400 cm⁻¹ suggests overlapping O–H stretching vibrations from the hydroxymethyl (–CH2OH) group and N–H stretching from the secondary amide moiety. The sharp, strong absorption at ~1650 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of the amide group, a hallmark of its presence. Aromatic C=C stretching vibrations are evident in the region 1600–1450 cm⁻¹, with multiple peaks reflecting the conjugated quinoxaline-like heterocyclic system and substituted benzene rings. The peak near 1250 cm⁻¹ likely corresponds to C–N stretching in the amide and heterocyclic framework, while the band at ~1100 cm⁻¹ may arise from C–O stretching in the hydroxymethyl group. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex, sharp peaks due to out-of-plane bending vibrations of aromatic C–H bonds and skeletal deformations of the polycyclic structure. Notably, the absence of strong absorptions near 1700 cm⁻¹ (outside the amide C=O) and 2200 cm⁻¹ (no nitrile or alkyne) aligns with the molecular formula. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the amide, alcohol, and aromatic/heteroaromatic functionalities in the compound."

The base peak at m/z 227 represents the most abundant fragment, likely formed by the loss of ammonia (NH3, 17 Da) from the molecular ion, yielding a stable cationic fragment. Additional prominent peaks at m/z 228 and 229 arise from isotopic contributions of chlorine (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl), consistent with the molecule’s two chlorine substituents. The peak at m/z 193 suggests further fragmentation, potentially involving cleavage of the benzylic C–N bond, retaining the dichlorophenyl and trifluoromethyl groups. Peaks at m/z 157 and 159, with a 3:1 intensity ratio, indicate a fragment containing a single chlorine atom, likely a dichlorophenyl cation derivative.

A broad, intense absorption band centered near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the O-H stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group, indicative of hydrogen bonding interactions. Sharp peaks near 3000 cm⁻¹ arise from C-H stretching vibrations in both aromatic and aliphatic environments, with the latter appearing slightly lower in wavenumber due to sp³ hybridization. A prominent band at approximately 1600 cm⁻¹ is attributed to C=C stretching vibrations within the aromatic rings, while weaker absorptions around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹ further support the presence of conjugated π-systems. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) exhibits complex multiplets, including C-H in-plane bending modes and ring deformation vibrations, which are typical for fused aromatic systems. Notably, the absence of a distinct carbonyl (C=O) stretching band near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of ketone or aldehyde functionality in this structure. The spectral profile aligns with the expected vibrational characteristics of a hydroxyl-substituted polycyclic hydrocarbon framework, where the rigid bicyclic system (as implied by the SMILES notation) contributes to the observed band splitting and intensity patterns.

The aromatic region (6–8 ppm in ¹H, 120–140 ppm in ¹³C) exhibits multiple cross-peaks, corresponding to the benzene ring protons and their attached carbons. These signals are consistent with the substituted aromatic system in the structure, where electron-withdrawing effects from the OCH₂CONH₂ group likely shift some aromatic carbons downfield. A prominent cluster of peaks near 3–4 ppm (¹H) and 60–70 ppm (¹³C) reflects the OCH₂ group adjacent to the amide functionality, with the oxygen atom deshielding both the proton and carbon nuclei. Additional aliphatic signals around 1.5–2.5 ppm (¹H) and 25–40 ppm (¹³C) correspond to the cyclohexane ring methylene groups in the [C@H]1CCc2...C1 moiety, showing typical upfield shifts for saturated carbons. The absence of peaks in the 170–180 ppm range (¹³C) confirms that the carbonyl carbons (ester and amide) lack directly bonded protons, as expected for quaternary carbonyl centers. The tert-butyl group (C(CH₃)₃) does not produce observable HSQC signals due to its quaternary central carbon and rapid methyl group rotation, which averages out coupling interactions.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates ¹H and ¹³C chemical shifts for directly bonded proton-carbon pairs, providing insights into the molecular structure. The spectrum displays distinct cross-peaks corresponding to various functional groups in the molecule. In the aromatic region (¹H: 6.5–8.5 ppm; ¹³C: 100–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the presence of the phenyl and pyrimidine rings. The pyrimidine ring (c2cnc(N)nc2N) contributes peaks near 7.5–8.0 ppm (¹H) and 130–140 ppm (¹³C), consistent with aromatic CH groups adjacent to nitrogen atoms. The phenyl ring substituted with the sulfonyl group (S(C)(=O)=O) exhibits peaks in the 7.0–7.8 ppm (¹H) and 125–135 ppm (¹³C) range, indicating deshielding effects from the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group.

These peaks confirm the presence of two equivalent ethoxy substituents on the central aromatic ring. A prominent peak at ~3.0 ppm (¹H) and ~35 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methylene bridge (CH2) linking the central aromatic ring to the pyrimidine moiety. This downfield shift for the methylene protons suggests proximity to the electron-deficient pyrimidine ring. The sulfonyl group itself does not produce HSQC peaks, as it lacks directly bonded protons. However, its influence is evident in the deshielded aromatic carbons of the adjacent phenyl ring. Overall, the HSQC spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, confirming the connectivity of aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic components. The observed chemical shifts and peak patterns validate the functional group assignments and provide a detailed map of proton-carbon correlations in this sulfonamide-containing heterocycle."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in this heterocyclic compound. The most prominent feature is a sharp, high-intensity peak at approximately 150 ppm, which likely corresponds to a quaternary carbon atom directly bonded to electronegative nitrogen or chlorine atoms within the fused pyrazole-pyridine core. This downfield shift is consistent with deshielding effects from adjacent heteroatoms. Additional intense peaks are observed at ~120 ppm and ~110 ppm, which can be assigned to aromatic carbons in the phenyl rings (c3ccccc3) and the trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl group (c2ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc2), respectively. These shifts align with typical aromatic carbon resonances, with the trifluoromethyl group inducing further deshielding due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature. A moderate peak at ~50 ppm suggests the presence of a methyl group (Cn1...) attached to a nitrogen atom, consistent with the SMILES notation. A smaller peak near 30 ppm may correspond to a sp3-hybridized carbon in a less electronegative environment, though its low intensity indicates limited abundance or overlap with other signals.

Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 93, 133, 157, 184, 225, 242, 283, 311, and 327, representing structurally diagnostic fragments. The peak at m/z 93 corresponds to the aniline-derived fragment (C6H7N), suggesting cleavage of the cyclohexene ring adjacent to the aromatic system. Peaks at m/z 133 and 157 may arise from further fragmentation of the piperidine ring (C7H13N) or combined losses of small neutral molecules like ammonia (NH3) or water (H2O) from intermediate ions. The m/z 184 peak likely represents a fragment retaining the piperidine ring with partial substitution (e.g., C10H16N2O), while m/z 225 and 242 suggest retention of the tert-butyl ester group (C12H21NO2) or its derivatives. Notably, the m/z 283 peak corresponds to a loss of C5H10 (70 Da) from the molecular ion, possibly via retro-Diels-Alder fragmentation of the cyclohexene moiety. The m/z 311 and 327 peaks may result from partial dealkylation or rearrangement of the piperidine ring. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 385 confirms the molecular ion’s stability under the ionization conditions.

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C17H14N2O2 (SMILES: O=C1NN=C2c3ccccc3OCC2C1c1ccccc1). The spectrum displays a molecular ion peak at m/z 279, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the molecular weight of 278 g/mol for C17H14N2O2. The base peak at m/z 146, the most intense signal, suggests a stable fragment ion, likely arising from cleavage of the benzofuran ring system or loss of a phenyl group (C6H5, 77 Da) from the molecular ion, leaving a C11H9N2O2+ fragment (calculated m/z 201). However, the observed m/z 146 indicates further fragmentation, possibly involving decarboxylation or rearrangement. Prominent peaks at m/z 91 and 105 are characteristic of tropylium ions (C7H7+) and benzoyl fragments (C7H5O+), respectively, confirming the presence of aromatic rings in the structure. Additional signals at m/z 120, 130, and 131 suggest heterocyclic ring fragmentation, potentially involving the pyrazolone moiety (N-N-C=O). Peaks in the range m/z 202–207 and 218–233 indicate multistage fragmentation, possibly retaining portions of the benzofuran and phenyl groups. The peak at m/z 261 corresponds to a loss of 18 Da (H2O) from the molecular ion, implying the presence of a hydroxyl or carbonyl group. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s polycyclic architecture, with multiple fragmentation pathways driven by the stability of aromatic and heteroaromatic fragments. The observed peaks align with the structural features of the SMILES notation, including the benzofuran (c3ccccc3OCC2) and pyrazolone (N-N=C2) subunits. No significant peaks above m/z 279 are observed, confirming the molecular ion’s identity. This mass spectral profile provides critical insights into the compound’s structural integrity and fragmentation behavior under ionization."

The spectrum exhibits several key features characteristic of its functional groups. A sharp, intense peak at ~3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to N–H stretching vibrations from the two amide groups (NC(=O)N) in the structure, indicating strong hydrogen bonding. The broadness of this peak suggests secondary amide involvement. A prominent absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching of the amide functionalities, consistent with their electron-withdrawing nature. Additional sharp peaks in the 2800–3000 cm⁻¹ region arise from C–H stretching of aliphatic (tert-butyl group) and aromatic (phenyl rings) hydrocarbons. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays multiple peaks, including a distinct band at ~1600 cm⁻¹ (C=C aromatic stretching) and a weaker peak near 1250 cm⁻¹ (C–N stretching of the pyrimidine ring). The absence of strong absorptions near 2200 cm⁻¹ confirms no nitrile or alkyne groups are present. The iodine substituent (I) on the aromatic ring does not produce direct IR-active signals but may influence adjacent bond polarities. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected vibrational modes of this heterocyclic, amide-rich structure, providing evidence for its functional group composition and molecular framework."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C14H16BrN3O2 (SMILES: CC(C)(C)OC(=O)Nc1cc(-c2cccc(Br)c2)n[nH]1). The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. The most intense peak, located near 0 ppm, corresponds to the three equivalent methyl carbons of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group, which are highly shielded due to their aliphatic nature and symmetry. A prominent peak at ~80 ppm is attributed to the quaternary carbon of the Boc group, which is deshielded by its direct attachment to oxygen. The carbonyl carbon of the Boc group appears as a moderate-intensity peak near 150 ppm, consistent with the typical downfield shift of carbonyl carbons in carbamate functionalities. In the aromatic region (100–150 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the substituted phenyl and pyrazole rings. The phenyl ring, substituted with bromine at the meta position, exhibits several distinct signals due to the deshielding effects of the electronegative bromine atom and the asymmetric substitution pattern. The pyrazole ring carbons, particularly those adjacent to nitrogen atoms, resonate in this region as well, with shifts influenced by the electron-withdrawing Boc-protected amine and the phenyl substituent. A small peak near 30 ppm may correspond to residual solvent or minor impurities, though the primary features align with the expected structure. The spectrum’s simplicity in the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm) confirms the absence of additional alkyl groups beyond the Boc moiety. The lack of overlapping peaks in the aromatic region suggests limited symmetry in the aromatic systems, consistent with the molecular structure. Overall, the chemical shifts and intensities correlate well with the proposed structure, validating the presence of the Boc-protected amine, brominated phenyl ring, and pyrazole core."

The spectrum displays five distinct carbon environments, consistent with the molecular symmetry of the compound. The most prominent peak at approximately 21 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent methyl groups (-CH3) attached to the aromatic rings, exhibiting high intensity due to their proton-coupled nature. A triplet at 45 ppm arises from the central quaternary carbon bonded to two trifluoromethyl (-CF3) groups, showing characteristic splitting from adjacent fluorine atoms. Three aromatic carbon signals appear between 125-140 ppm: a singlet at 128 ppm for the para-substituted aromatic carbons, a doublet at 130 ppm for meta carbons, and a singlet at 140 ppm for the ipso carbons bearing the bulky substituents. The absence of additional peaks confirms the molecule's high symmetry, with equivalent environments for both benzene rings and methyl groups. The trifluoromethyl carbons appear as a singlet near 125 ppm, slightly upfield due to their electron-withdrawing nature. Peak intensities and chemical shifts align with expected shielding/deshielding effects from the substituents, while the lack of fine splitting in aromatic signals suggests rapid molecular tumbling averaging out fluorine couplings. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the compound's structural features, including aromatic substitution patterns, methyl group equivalence, and the electronic influence of trifluoromethyl groups."

The spectrum displays characteristic chemical shifts corresponding to distinct carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak, observed near 170 ppm, is attributed to the carbonyl carbon of the acetamide group (NHC(C)=O), a typical region for amide C=O resonances. Aromatic carbons appear between 120–140 ppm, with multiple peaks reflecting the substituted benzene ring’s symmetry. The para-substituted aromatic ring (methoxy and sulfonamide groups) generates four distinct aromatic carbon signals due to equivalent positions. A peak near 55 ppm corresponds to the methoxy group (-OCH3), while a broader resonance around 60–65 ppm arises from the hydroxymethyl (-CH2OH) carbon. The sulfonamide-linked methylene (-CH2-SO2-) appears at ~50–55 ppm, influenced by the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group. Adjacent to this, the methylene group in the -CH2-NH- moiety is observed at ~40–45 ppm. The acetamide methyl group (-COCH3) resonates at ~20–25 ppm, consistent with aliphatic methyl carbons. Notably, the spectrum lacks signals above 200 ppm, confirming the absence of ketone or carboxylic acid carbonyls.

Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (1H: 6–8 ppm; 13C: 110–160 ppm)**: Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to the two benzene rings in the structure. The fluorine substituent on one aromatic ring (c2ccccc2F) induces deshielding, likely shifting adjacent protons and carbons downfield.

Additional peaks in this region may arise from methylene (CH2) groups adjacent to heteroatoms (e.g., the CN and S-linked carbons). 4. **Sulfonamide-Linked Carbons**: The sulfonamide group (S1(=O)=O) influences nearby carbons, particularly the aromatic carbons bonded to nitrogen. These may exhibit downfield shifts (13C: 140–160 ppm) due to electron-withdrawing effects. The absence of peaks in the carbonyl region (13C: 170–200 ppm) confirms no ketone or carboxylic acid groups are present.

The splitting pattern reflects complex coupling interactions: the fluorine atom at position 3 and the CF3 group at position 5 induce both direct (ortho/para) and long-range coupling, leading to multiplet-like signals. The NH proton of the secondary amine (attached to the pyridine) may contribute to the broader signals in this region, though its exact position is obscured by overlapping aromatic peaks. The absence of peaks above 8 ppm confirms no strongly acidic protons (e.g., carboxylic acids), and the lack of signals below 1 ppm excludes methyl groups in highly shielded environments. The spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, where the Boc-protected bicyclic amine and substituted pyridine dominate the proton environments. Fluorine-induced splitting and the rigid bicyclic framework significantly influence the spectral pattern, providing key insights into the molecule’s conformation and electronic effects."

The spectrum displays a prominent protonated molecular ion peak at m/z 398, corresponding to [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 397.48 g/mol for C20H27N7O2. The base peak at m/z 121 (100% relative abundance) suggests a highly stable fragment, likely originating from cleavage of the triazole ring or the N-linked benzyl group. Additional significant peaks at m/z 91 and 107 may arise from fragmentation of the aromatic methoxybenzyl moiety, with m/z 91 characteristic of a tropylium ion (C7H7+) derived from the benzyl group. The peak at m/z 122 (15% abundance) could represent a secondary fragment involving the triazole-pyrimidine core. The absence of major peaks above m/z 398 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity, while the low abundance of intermediate fragments (e.g., m/z 107, 122) indicates selective bond cleavage pathways. These observations are consistent with the structural features of the molecule, including the tert-butylamino group, triazole ring, and methoxybenzyl substituent, which influence both ionization efficiency and fragmentation behavior.

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks corresponding to the protons in the molecule. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), two prominent doublets are observed at approximately 7.5 ppm and 8.0 ppm, each integrating to 2H. These correspond to the para-substituted benzene ring protons, with the downfield doublet (8.0 ppm) assigned to the ortho protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl chloride group (C(=O)Cl), which deshields these protons. The upfield doublet (7.5 ppm) corresponds to the meta protons. A singlet at ~5.5 ppm (2H) is attributed to the benzylic methylene group (OCH2) of the propoxymethyl substituent, which is deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom. The propyl chain (OCH2CH2CH3) exhibits three distinct signals: a triplet at ~3.5 ppm (2H, OCH2CH2), a sextet at ~2.0 ppm (2H, CH2CH3), and a triplet at ~1.0 ppm (3H, CH3). These splitting patterns arise from spin-spin coupling between neighboring protons, consistent with the propyl group’s structure. The absence of signals in the 9–12 ppm range confirms no aldehydic or carboxylic acid protons are present, aligning with the molecular structure. Minor peaks at ~10.5 ppm and ~11.5 ppm may indicate trace impurities or solvent artifacts, as they do not correspond to the target molecule. Overall, the spectrum’s features—aromatic splitting, benzylic methylene singlet, and propyl chain multiplets—validate the proposed structure of 4-(propoxymethyl)benzoyl chloride."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption features consistent with the functional groups present in this sulfonyl-substituted imidazole derivative. Key spectral features include: 1. **O-H/N-H Region (3500–3200 cm⁻¹):** A broad, moderate-intensity band near 3400 cm⁻¹ likely corresponds to aromatic C-H stretching vibrations from the imidazole ring. The absence of sharp, intense peaks in this region suggests no free O-H or N-H groups, consistent with the tertiary amine (N-CH₃) and sulfonyl (S=O) substituents in the structure. 2. **Aliphatic C-H Region (3000–2850 cm⁻¹):** Sharp peaks around 2950–2850 cm⁻¹ are attributed to symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching vibrations of the butyl chain (CH₂ and CH₃ groups). These bands confirm the presence of aliphatic hydrocarbons in the molecule. 3. **Fingerprint Region (1700–600 cm⁻¹):** - A strong, sharp peak near 1600 cm⁻¹ is indicative of C=N stretching vibrations in the imidazole ring, a hallmark of heteroaromatic systems. - Two prominent bands at ~1350 cm⁻¹ and ~1150 cm⁻¹ correspond to asymmetric and symmetric S=O stretching vibrations, respectively, confirming the sulfonyl (SO₂) functional group. The intensity and splitting pattern of these peaks are typical for sulfones. - Additional peaks below 1000 cm⁻¹ may arise from C-S stretching or out-of-plane ring deformations, though these are less diagnostic. The overall spectral profile aligns with the molecular structure: the imidazole ring contributes aromatic C-H and C=N features, the butyl chain provides aliphatic C-H absorptions, and the sulfonyl group dominates the S=O stretching region. No extraneous peaks (e.g., carbonyl C=O near 1700 cm⁻¹) are observed, supporting the absence of unintended functional groups. This IR spectrum effectively corroborates the structural assignment of CCCC(C1=NC=CN(C)C1)=S(=O)=O."

The spectrum displays three distinct cross-peaks, indicating correlations between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei. The first peak appears at approximately 10 ppm (¹H) and 100 ppm (¹³C), corresponding to an aromatic proton attached to a sp²-hybridized carbon in the heterocyclic ring system. This carbon likely resides in an electron-deficient environment, such as adjacent to a nitrogen atom, which deshields the nucleus and shifts the resonance downfield. The second peak at ~12 ppm (¹H) and ~150 ppm (¹³C) suggests a highly deshielded aromatic proton, potentially on a carbon flanked by multiple nitrogen atoms in the fused pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine core. Such extreme downfield shifts are characteristic of protons near electronegative heteroatoms or in conjugated systems with strong ring currents. The third peak at ~3 ppm (¹H) and ~30 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the tert-butyl group’s methyl protons and their directly attached carbon. The upfield position of this signal reflects the electron-donating nature of the tert-butyl substituent, which shields the carbon and hydrogen nuclei. Collectively, these features confirm the presence of both aliphatic and aromatic regions in the molecule, with the HSQC data providing direct evidence for the connectivity between specific ¹H and ¹³C atoms in the structure.

The base peak at m/z 189 represents the most abundant fragment, likely corresponding to the molecular ion after loss of a methyl group (CH3, 15 Da) and a carbonyl fragment (CO, 28 Da), yielding a stable cationic species retaining the Boc-protected pyrrolidine core.

The peak at m/z 70 is consistent with a pyrrolidine-derived fragment (C4H8N+), formed via ring cleavage and hydrogen rearrangement. This fragment is a hallmark of saturated nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The tert-butyl cation (C4H9+, m/z 57) is a classic diagnostic ion for Boc-protected compounds, arising from the loss of CO2 from the Boc group. Additional peaks at m/z 69, 76, 85, and 115 likely stem from smaller, less stable fragments, such as alkyl or acyl radicals generated by bond cleavage adjacent to the carbamate or Boc groups.

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C24H23Cl2N5O3 (SMILES: Cc1[nH]c(=O)c2c(ccc3nc(Nc4c(Cl)cccc4Cl)n(C)c32)c1CC(=O)N1CCOCC1). The spectrum displays distinct carbon environments characteristic of a complex heterocyclic structure. The most prominent peaks appear in the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), with a particularly intense signal near 180 ppm, indicative of a carbonyl carbon (likely from the amide group at position C19). Additional high-intensity peaks at ~160–170 ppm suggest aromatic carbons adjacent to electronegative atoms, such as the nitrogen-substituted carbons in the fused imidazoquinoline system. The cluster of signals between 120–140 ppm corresponds to the aromatic carbons of the dichlorophenyl ring (C4–C9) and the fused bicyclic core, with splitting patterns reflecting the symmetry of the aromatic systems. A notable peak at ~60–70 ppm aligns with the quaternary carbon in the morpholine ring (C24), while signals in the 40–50 ppm range likely arise from the methylene carbons (C22 and C23) adjacent to the morpholine nitrogen. The aliphatic region (0–40 ppm) shows a sharp peak near 20 ppm, assignable to the methyl group (C1) attached to the pyridone ring, and a broader signal at ~10 ppm, possibly from the methyl substituent (C18) on the imidazole ring. The absence of signals below 0 ppm confirms no sp³-hybridized carbons with extreme shielding. The distribution of peak intensities reflects the molecule’s structural complexity, with overlapping resonances in the aromatic region due to the fused ring system and substituent effects from chlorine atoms (C5 and C9) causing deshielding. This spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule’s carbon framework, validating the presence of key functional groups and aiding in structural confirmation."

    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C13H17NO2 (SMILES: CN1CCC(COc2ccc(C=O)cc2)C1). The spectrum exhibits several key features consistent with the structural components of the molecule. A strong, sharp absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the stretching vibration of the aldehyde carbonyl group (C=O), a hallmark of the formyl substituent on the aromatic ring. This peak is unambiguously assigned to the C=O bond in the p-substituted benzaldehyde moiety. Adjacent to this, weaker absorptions near 2820 and 2720 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the aldehyde C-H stretching vibrations, further confirming the presence of the formyl group. A prominent band near 1600 cm⁻¹ arises from the aromatic C=C stretching vibrations of the benzene ring, which is also substituted with an ether linkage (O-CH2-). The ether functionality is evidenced by a broad, intense absorption near 1100 cm⁻¹, attributed to the C-O-C asymmetric stretching mode. Additional aliphatic C-H stretching vibrations appear between 2900–2800 cm⁻¹, consistent with the morpholine ring (CN1CCC(CO-)C1) and its saturated carbon framework. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex bending and deformation vibrations, including potential contributions from the morpholine ring’s C-N bond (expected near 1250–1350 cm⁻¹) and aromatic C-H in-plane deformations. The absence of broad absorptions near 3300 cm⁻¹ indicates no O-H or N-H functional groups, aligning with the molecular structure. Collectively, these spectral features corroborate the assigned structure, highlighting the aldehyde, ether, and tertiary amine functionalities within the molecule."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C12H13BrN2O3 (SMILES: COc1cc2nc(CBr)c(OC)nc2cc1OC). The spectrum displays three distinct cross-peaks, correlating proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts for directly bonded atom pairs. The most downfield ¹H resonance appears at approximately 10.5 ppm, paired with a ¹³C shift near 100 ppm. This peak likely corresponds to an aromatic proton on the benzoxazole ring, influenced by electron-withdrawing effects from adjacent nitrogen atoms, which deshield the proton and shift its resonance downfield. The associated carbon at 100 ppm is consistent with a sp²-hybridized aromatic carbon in an electron-deficient heterocyclic system. A second cross-peak at 7.5 ppm (¹H) and 120 ppm (¹³C) suggests another aromatic proton-carbon pair, likely part of the benzene ring fused to the benzoxazole moiety. The intermediate chemical shift values reflect moderate electron density in this region, typical of methoxy-substituted aromatic systems. The third cross-peak at 3.8 ppm (¹H) and 60 ppm (¹³C) aligns with methoxy (–OCH₃) groups, where the proton resonance is shielded by oxygen’s electron-donating effects, and the carbon shift reflects direct attachment to oxygen. Notably, the bromomethyl (–CH₂Br) group predicted by the SMILES notation does not produce observable cross-peaks in this spectrum. This absence may arise from rapid relaxation of the bromomethyl protons due to the heavy bromine atom, leading to signal broadening beyond detection limits, or experimental parameters optimized for aromatic/methoxy regions. The observed peaks collectively confirm the presence of aromatic and methoxy functionalities, while the missing bromomethyl signals highlight limitations in sensitivity or resolution for certain moieties. The spectrum provides partial structural validation, emphasizing the electron-deficient aromatic system and methoxy substitutions critical to the molecule’s identity."

The spectrum displays characteristic peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, reflecting the proton environments in this heterocyclic compound. Key features include two prominent singlets at 11.5 ppm and 10.8 ppm, corresponding to the two exchangeable NH protons in the molecule: one from the secondary amine (NH-C3H) and the other from the amide-like NH group in the benzimidazole core. These high-field shifts indicate strong hydrogen bonding or deshielding effects from adjacent electronegative atoms. Aromatic protons appear as a triplet at 7.8 ppm and a doublet at 7.4 ppm, integrating to two protons total. These signals arise from the chlorinated benzene ring (C3), where the electron-withdrawing Cl substituents deshield the remaining protons, shifting them downfield. The splitting pattern suggests a 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene arrangement. A broad multiplet between 4.5–5.2 ppm integrates to three protons, consistent with the three hydroxyl groups (OH) on the cyclohexane ring (C1), which exhibit variable chemical shifts due to hydrogen bonding and rapid exchange. A triplet at 3.8 ppm (2H) corresponds to the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the oxygen atom in the cyclohexane ring, split by neighboring protons. A singlet at 2.0 ppm (2H) is attributed to the cyclopropyl protons (C3H2), which resonate upfield due to the ring’s strain-induced shielding. Additional minor peaks between 1.0–2.5 ppm may represent aliphatic protons in the cyclohexane ring, though their exact assignment requires further analysis. The spectrum’s integration and splitting patterns align with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of aromatic, aliphatic, and exchangeable protons in their expected environments. The absence of signals below 0 ppm or above 12 ppm rules out significant impurities or decomposition products. This H-NMR profile provides critical insights into the molecule’s conformational and electronic properties, particularly the influence of chlorine substituents and hydrogen-bonding interactions on proton shielding."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks corresponding to one-bond correlations between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei. Key features include: (1) Aromatic region signals between 6–8 ppm (¹H) and 120–150 ppm (¹³C), consistent with the benzene ring (c1ccc(C(=O)OC)cc1) and the substituted pyrimidine/imidazole rings (nc2c(C)cc(C)nc2n1).

(2) A distinct cross-peak near 3.8 ppm (¹H) and 52 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methoxy group (-OCH₃) of the ester functionality (C(=O)OC), where the protonated carbon appears deshielded due to electronegative oxygen substitution. (3) Aliphatic signals between 1–3 ppm (¹H) and 10–30 ppm (¹³C) arise from the ethyl group (CCc1...) and methyl substituents (c(C)...) on the heterocycles. The ethyl -CH₂- group shows correlations near 2.5 ppm (¹H) and 25 ppm (¹³C), while the methyl groups appear as more shielded peaks around 2.2–2.4 ppm (¹H) and 18–22 ppm (¹³C). (4) The carbonyl carbon of the ester (C(=O)) is observed near 165–170 ppm (¹³C), though its direct proton correlation is absent due to the lack of directly attached protons. The HSQC data effectively maps protonated carbons, aiding in the assignment of aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic substructures within this polycyclic system."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides a two-dimensional correlation between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the molecule. The x-axis represents the ¹H chemical shift (ppm), while the y-axis corresponds to the ¹³C chemical shift (ppm). The spectrum exhibits distinct clusters of cross-peaks characteristic of aromatic, aliphatic, and heteroatom-substituted environments. In the aromatic region (6–8 ppm for ¹H and 110–140 ppm for ¹³C), multiple cross-peaks are observed, consistent with the presence of two aromatic systems: the indole ring (cc2ccccc2n1) and the brominated phenyl ring (c1ccccc1Br). The indole ring’s protons (e.g., H-4 to H-7) appear as a series of cross-peaks in this region, with ¹³C shifts slightly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent nitrogen. The brominated phenyl ring shows similar aromatic correlations, with additional deshielding of carbons ortho and para to the bromine substituent (¹³C shifts approaching ~130–140 ppm). A prominent cross-peak near 3.5 ppm (¹H) and 40 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the benzyl methylene group (CH₂) attached to the tertiary nitrogen (CN(Cc1...)). This signal is shifted downfield compared to typical aliphatic CH₂ groups due to the electron-withdrawing amide carbonyl (C=O) and the adjacent aromatic system. Another distinct cross-peak at ~3.0 ppm (¹H) and ~25 ppm (¹³C) is attributed to the methyl group (CH₃) on the indole nitrogen (n1C), which appears upfield due to its aliphatic nature and lack of direct conjugation with electron-withdrawing groups. The absence of cross-peaks in the carbonyl region (160–180 ppm for ¹³C) is expected, as the amide carbonyl (C=O) and quaternary aromatic carbons lack directly attached protons. Similarly, the bromine atom does not contribute to HSQC signals, as it is not covalently bound to a protonated carbon. Overall, the HSQC spectrum aligns with the structural features of CN(Cc1cc2ccccc2n1C)C(=O)c1ccccc1Br, clearly resolving correlations for aromatic CH, the benzyl CH₂, and the N-methyl CH₃ groups. These observations confirm the molecule’s connectivity and provide insight into the electronic effects of substituents on chemical shifts."

The base peak at m/z 91 is characteristic of a benzyl cation (C7H7+), a common fragment in aromatic compounds, likely arising from cleavage of the ethyl linker between the two phenyl rings. Prominent peaks at m/z 105 and 116 suggest fragmentation involving the amide (C=O-NH-CH3) and imine (C=N-OCH3) groups, with 105 corresponding to a benzoyl-like fragment (C7H5NO+) and 116 to a methoxyphenyl-imine fragment (C8H8NO+). Additional peaks at m/z 144 and 172 indicate further decomposition of the aromatic system, possibly involving loss of methyl or hydroxyl groups.

The molecular ion peak [M]+ is observed at m/z 208, corresponding to the intact molecule. However, the base peak (most abundant fragment) appears at m/z 148, indicating significant fragmentation under the ionization conditions. This dominant peak likely arises from the loss of a C3H6O2 fragment (60 Da), possibly corresponding to the cleavage of the ester group (COOCH3) and adjacent carbon atoms from the tetrahydrofuran ring. Additional key peaks include m/z 136, 150, 176, and 194. The peak at m/z 136 may result from further fragmentation of the m/z 148 ion, potentially involving loss of a CH2 group (14 Da). The pair of peaks at m/z 148 and 150 (with lower abundance) could indicate isotopic contributions or alternative fragmentation pathways. The peak at m/z 176 suggests a loss of 32 Da from the molecular ion, consistent with the removal of an OCH3 group. Similarly, m/z 194 corresponds to a loss of 14 Da (CH2) from the molecular ion, likely from the tetrahydrofuran ring. Smaller peaks in the lower m/z range (e.g., 78, 79, 80) are characteristic of the pyridine ring substructure, with m/z 79 representing the pyridine radical cation. The peak at m/z 105 may originate from the cleavage of the C–O bond in the ester group, retaining the pyridine and part of the tetrahydrofuran moiety. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule: the ester group, pyridine ring, and tetrahydrofuran substituent. The base peak at m/z 148 highlights the stability of the fragment retaining the pyridine core and part of the side chain, while the molecular ion peak at m/z 208 confirms the molecular weight of the compound. This spectrum exemplifies typical behavior of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing heterocycles under mass spectrometric analysis, with cleavage pathways dominated by the ester and cyclic ether functionalities."

The HSQC spectrum provides a two-dimensional correlation between proton (1H) and directly attached carbon (13C) chemical shifts, offering insights into the molecule’s aliphatic and aromatic regions. The spectrum displays distinct clusters of peaks across the 1H (0–14 ppm) and 13C (0–200 ppm) axes. Notably, the 13C axis exhibits a prominent peak near 170 ppm, which likely corresponds to a carbonyl carbon (amide or carbamate group) despite the absence of a directly attached proton, suggesting potential experimental artifacts or long-range couplings. However, the majority of observed correlations align with expected aliphatic and heteroaromatic features. In the aromatic region (1H: 6–8 ppm; 13C: 120–140 ppm), two peaks are visible, consistent with the thiophene ring’s vinylic protons and their attached carbons. These shifts reflect the electron-withdrawing effects of the sulfur atom and adjacent substituents. The aliphatic region (1H: 0.8–4 ppm; 13C: 10–60 ppm) shows multiple correlations, including: 1. **Methyl groups**: Peaks near 1H 1.4 ppm/13C 28 ppm and 1H 1.8 ppm/13C 40 ppm likely correspond to the tert-butyl groups (C(C)(C)C) and N-methyl substituents, respectively. 2. **Methylene groups**: Correlations at 1H 2.2–3.0 ppm/13C 20–55 ppm arise from the propyl chain (CNCCC) and the aminomethyl group (CNCC(C)(C)C), with shifts influenced by neighboring nitrogen atoms. 3. **Carbamate/amide environments**: The N-methyl group in the carbamate (OCONCH3) appears at ~1H 3.0 ppm/13C 35 ppm, while the amide N-methyl (CONCH3) overlaps in a similar region. The absence of peaks in the 13C carbonyl region (155–175 ppm) for directly bonded protons aligns with the molecule’s structure, as the carbamate and amide carbonyls lack attached hydrogens. Overall, the spectrum reflects the molecule’s structural complexity, with clear differentiation between aromatic, aliphatic, and functional group environments. This analysis underscores the utility of HSQC in resolving carbon-proton connectivity in heteroatom-rich systems."

The aromatic C-H stretching vibrations are observed in the 3000–3100 cm⁻¹ region, with distinct peaks near 3050 cm⁻¹, confirming the presence of the benzene ring. Additionally, a broad band around 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests N-H stretching from the hydrazine (CNN) moiety, though its intensity is moderate, likely due to hydrogen bonding or overlapping with other vibrations. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), multiple peaks arise from complex aromatic C=C stretching and C-H bending modes. A notable absorption near 1600 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the aromatic ring’s conjugated C=C bonds, while bands between 1450–1200 cm⁻¹ reflect combined contributions from C-O stretching of the ester and C-N stretching from the hydrazine group. The sharp peak near 1000 cm⁻¹ may indicate out-of-plane C-H bending vibrations of the para-substituted benzene ring, supporting the substitution pattern implied by the SMILES notation. The absence of broad O-H stretching bands (typically 2500–3300 cm⁻¹) confirms the lack of carboxylic acid or alcohol groups, aligning with the ester functionality. Similarly, no strong absorptions in the 2200–2300 cm⁻¹ region rule out nitrile or alkyne groups.

Key observations include: 1. **Aldehyde Carbon**: A prominent peak near 200 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the aldehyde group in the OCCC=O side chain. This high chemical shift reflects the strong deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen atom. 2. **Aromatic Carbons**: Multiple peaks between 120–150 ppm arise from the two aromatic rings. The benzene ring substituted with the chlorine atom (c2cccc(Cl)c2) shows resonances in this range, with the carbon directly bonded to chlorine appearing at a slightly higher shift (~135 ppm) due to the inductive effect of Cl.

The spectrum’s peak distribution aligns with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of aromatic, aliphatic, and carbonyl functionalities. The chemical shifts are consistent with substituent effects, such as the deshielding of aromatic carbons by Cl and SO2 groups and the high-field shift of the methyl group.

The most downfield peaks at approximately 160 ppm and 150 ppm correspond to the two carbonyl carbons (C=O) in the bicyclic ring system, which are highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent oxygen atoms. These peaks confirm the presence of two distinct carbonyl groups in asymmetric environments. Aromatic or conjugated carbons in the fused ring system appear between 110–130 ppm, with peaks at ~130 ppm and ~110 ppm. These shifts are consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons in a heteroaromatic framework, likely part of the purine-like bicyclic core. The peak at ~80 ppm and ~70 ppm are assigned to the sp-hybridized carbons of the terminal alkyne group (C#C) in the propargyl substituent. The higher shift (~80 ppm) corresponds to the carbon directly bonded to the nitrogen (CH₂-C≡C-N), while the lower shift (~70 ppm) corresponds to the terminal alkyne carbon (HC≡C-). The peak at ~30 ppm arises from the two methyl groups (-N-CH₃) attached to the nitrogens in the ring. Despite being in slightly different environments, their chemical shifts overlap, producing a single peak. No distinct peak is observed for the methylene carbon (CH₂) in the propargyl chain, suggesting it may overlap with other signals or exhibit low intensity due to relaxation effects. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected structure, with key features confirming the presence of carbonyl, aromatic, alkyne, and methyl functionalities. The absence of additional peaks indicates symmetry or equivalence in certain carbon environments, consistent with the molecular formula and SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 412, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of the compound. The base peak (highest relative abundance) appears at m/z 327, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. Key fragment ions at m/z 311, 298, 283, and 267 suggest sequential losses of neutral species, likely reflecting cleavage of the ethyl ester group (C2H5O, 45 Da) and isopropylamine (C3H7N, 58 Da) from the parent structure. Additional peaks at m/z 353 and 370 may arise from partial fragmentation of the pyrimidine or imidazole rings, while the peak at m/z 252 could correspond to a core heterocyclic fragment retaining the urea moiety. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 412 confirms the molecular ion assignment, and the fragmentation pattern is consistent with the proposed structure, particularly the presence of labile ester and urea functional groups.

A prominent isotope pattern is visible at m/z 220 and 222, reflecting the presence of a chlorine atom (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes in a ~3:1 ratio), which is a key diagnostic feature of the 7-chloroquinoline moiety in the structure. The base peak at m/z 263 (100% relative abundance) suggests a stable fragment ion, likely arising from cleavage of the urea linkage (–NHC(=O)–) and loss of the methoxypyridine group, leaving a piperazine-quinoline fragment. Additional significant peaks at m/z 261 and 263 may correspond to alternate fragmentation pathways involving the piperazine ring or further decomposition of the quinoline system. Smaller peaks at m/z 120 and 206 could represent smaller aromatic or aliphatic fragments, such as the methoxypyridine (m/z 120) or a partially degraded quinoline-piperazine unit. The peak at m/z 395 suggests a minor loss of 18 Da (possibly H₂O or NH₃) from the molecular ion, though this is less abundant compared to the base peak. The overall fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the urea bridge, piperazine ring, and halogenated aromatic systems, which are prone to homolytic cleavage and rearrangement under electron ionization conditions. This spectrum provides critical insights into the compound’s structural integrity and fragmentation behavior, essential for confirming its identity and purity."

The spectrum exhibits distinct peaks corresponding to the carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent feature is a sharp, high-intensity peak near 130 ppm, characteristic of aromatic carbons in the substituted benzene rings. This region reflects the multiple aromatic carbons in the biphenyl and phenyl groups, which dominate the spectrum due to their abundance. A moderate-intensity peak at ~170 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ester functional group, consistent with typical ester carbonyl shifts (160–180 ppm). Additional peaks between 110–130 ppm arise from the oxazole ring carbons (e.g., C4 and C5 in the oxazole moiety) and aromatic carbons adjacent to substituents like the thioether (-S-) and oxazole groups. The peak near 50 ppm is attributed to the methylene carbons (CH2) in the cyclopropane ring, which typically appear upfield due to their saturated nature. A smaller peak at ~30 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the oxazole ring, while the ethyl group (-CH2CH3) of the ester contributes peaks in the 10–20 ppm range, likely split into two signals for the CH2 and CH3 carbons. The absence of peaks below 10 ppm confirms no aliphatic quaternary carbons are present. The spectrum’s simplicity in the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm) aligns with the molecule’s structure, which contains limited non-aromatic carbons. The thioether carbon (-S-CH2-) likely overlaps with the cyclopropane methylene signals near 50 ppm, as sulfur-bound carbons often resonate in this range. Overall, the chemical shifts and peak intensities are consistent with the molecular framework, validating the presence of aromatic systems, ester functionality, oxazole heterocycle, and cyclopropane ring."

A sharp singlet at ~4.5 ppm integrates to 2H, attributed to the benzylic methylene (OCH2Ph), which is split by the carbonyl oxygen. The methoxy group (OCH3) appears as a singlet at ~3.5 ppm (3H), typical for methyl ethers. The piperidine ring protons generate a series of overlapping multiplets between 1.5–4.0 ppm. The methylene groups adjacent to the nitrogen (NCH2) are observed near ~2.5–3.0 ppm (4H, broad multiplet), while the remaining ring protons (CH2) appear at ~1.5–2.0 ppm (4H, multiplet). The ethyl linker (COCH2CH2N) contributes signals at ~3.2 ppm (2H, triplet, J ≈ 6 Hz) and ~2.6 ppm (2H, triplet, J ≈ 6 Hz), reflecting coupling between the two methylene groups. Notably, the NH proton (from the secondary amine in the COCCNC1 fragment) is not distinctly visible, likely due to rapid exchange with trace water or broadening effects. The absence of peaks above 8 ppm confirms no aldehyde or strongly acidic protons are present. The integration ratios and splitting patterns align with the proposed structure, supporting the assignment of the carbamate, benzyl, and aliphatic regions. This spectrum provides clear evidence for the molecular framework of the compound, with all observed signals consistent with the provided SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays characteristic carbon resonances consistent with the aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic components of the structure. The most prominent peaks appear between 160-100 ppm, indicative of sp²-hybridized carbons in aromatic rings and conjugated systems. A sharp peak near 160 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the pyrimidone moiety, while signals around 150-130 ppm arise from the pyrimidine ring carbons and the vinyl group (C=C) linking the aromatic systems. Multiple resonances between 130-110 ppm reflect the substituted phenyl ring carbons (C3-C6 in the phenyl group) and the imine carbon in the pyrimidine ring.

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range, reflecting the diverse proton environments in the molecule. The most prominent feature is a high-intensity singlet at approximately 5.0 ppm, which likely corresponds to the methylene protons (CH2) adjacent to the oxygen atom in the COCH2 group. This downfield shift from typical aliphatic protons (0.9–2.5 ppm) is consistent with the deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen atom. Additional peaks are observed in the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), including a moderate-intensity signal at ~7.5 ppm. This peak likely arises from the aromatic protons on the chlorophenyl ring (c2cccc(Cl)c2), which are split into a complex multiplet due to the meta-chloro substituent. The splitting pattern and integration would typically reflect the ring's substitution pattern, though the spectrum's resolution may obscure finer details. A smaller peak at ~10.0 ppm is consistent with the carboxylic acid proton (COOH), which appears as a broad singlet due to hydrogen bonding and rapid exchange with solvent molecules. Two additional low-intensity peaks at ~12.0 ppm and ~13.0 ppm are likely attributable to the two exchangeable protons in the urea moiety (NC(=O)N). These protons often appear as broad signals in the 5–12 ppm range, but their downfield shift here suggests strong hydrogen bonding or deshielding effects from the adjacent carbonyl groups. The absence of signals below 5 ppm (excluding the CH2 peak) indicates no isolated aliphatic protons, while the lack of peaks above 13 ppm rules out strongly acidic protons beyond those already assigned. The spectrum’s features align with the proposed structure, highlighting the molecule’s functional groups: a methoxyethyl side chain, a chlorinated aromatic ring, a carboxylic acid, and a urea fragment. Further analysis (e.g., integration, coupling constants) would refine these assignments, but the current data provides a clear overview of the proton environments in this compound."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts for directly bonded pairs. The ¹H axis (x-axis) spans ~14 to -2 ppm, while the ¹³C axis (y-axis) ranges from ~0 to 200 ppm. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (7–12 ppm, 1H; 120–150 ppm, ¹³C):** - A cluster of cross-peaks between 1H ~7–12 ppm and ¹³C ~120–150 ppm corresponds to aromatic protons and their attached carbons. These arise from the benzene ring (substituted with Cl) and the imidazole ring (part of the fused heterocyclic system). The downfield ¹H shifts (10–12 ppm) suggest deshielded protons, likely due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the Cl substituent and the adjacent nitrile (C#N) group. 2. **Methylene/Aliphatic Region (7 ppm, ¹H; 50 ppm, ¹³C):** - A distinct cross-peak at ~7 ppm (¹H) and ~50 ppm (¹³C) indicates a proton-carbon pair in a deshielded aliphatic environment. This is consistent with the methylene group (-CH₂-) adjacent to the nitrogen in the seven-membered diazepine ring. The elevated ¹H shift reflects the influence of the electronegative nitrogen and the ring’s electron-deficient nature. 3. **Nitrile and Carbonyl Absence:** - No cross-peaks are observed for the nitrile (C#N) or carbonyl (C=O) carbons (~115 ppm and ~165 ppm, respectively), as these carbons lack directly bonded protons and thus do not generate HSQC correlations. 4. **Overall Interpretation:** - The spectrum confirms the presence of aromatic and heteroaromatic systems, with chemical shifts aligning with the proposed structure. The HSQC data supports the assignment of the benzene and imidazole protons, as well as the methylene group in the diazepine ring. The absence of signals for quaternary carbons (e.g., C#N, C=O) is expected in HSQC experiments, which selectively detect protonated carbons. This analysis aligns with the molecular framework of the compound, highlighting the utility of HSQC in mapping proton-carbon connectivity in complex heterocycles."

The spectrum displays four distinct cross-peaks, each correlating a proton (¹H) chemical shift with its directly attached carbon (¹³C) chemical shift. These peaks provide insights into the molecular structure of 2-chloro-5-ethylpyridine. The most downfield peak at ~12 ppm (¹H) and ~150 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the aromatic proton at position 3 on the pyridine ring. This proton is adjacent to both the electronegative chlorine at position 2 and the nitrogen at position 1, causing significant deshielding. The carbon at position 3, directly bonded to this proton, exhibits a high ¹³C shift typical of a pyridine carbon near electron-withdrawing groups. A second aromatic peak at ~10 ppm (¹H) and ~130 ppm (¹³C) arises from the proton at position 6, which is ortho to the ring nitrogen. The nitrogen’s inductive effect deshields this proton, while its carbon resonates in the aromatic region. A third aromatic cross-peak at ~7 ppm (¹H) and ~120 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the proton at position 4, which experiences less deshielding due to its meta position relative to substituents. The aliphatic region shows a peak at ~2.5 ppm (¹H) and ~25 ppm (¹³C), assigned to the methylene (CH₂) group of the ethyl substituent at position 5. This carbon is directly attached to the ring, and its protons appear in the expected range for a CH₂ group adjacent to an aromatic system. Notably, the methyl (CH₃) group of the ethyl chain is not observed in this spectrum, likely due to relaxation effects or experimental parameters limiting detection of highly mobile groups. Overall, the HSQC spectrum confirms the presence of three aromatic CH environments and one aliphatic CH₂ group, consistent with the structure of 2-chloro-5-ethylpyridine. The chemical shifts align with the electronic effects of the chlorine and nitrogen substituents on the pyridine ring."

The spectrum displays four distinct proton environments, consistent with the molecular structure. The most downfield peak at approximately 11.0 ppm is a singlet, corresponding to the pyrazole ring proton at position 4, adjacent to the iodine substituent. This extreme downfield shift arises from strong deshielding by the electron-withdrawing iodine atom and the adjacent nitrogen atoms in the pyrazole ring. A second singlet at 10.0 ppm represents the pyrazole proton at position 5, which is also deshielded by the ring nitrogens but less so than the iodine-adjacent proton. The aromatic region shows two additional singlets. The peak at 9.0 ppm corresponds to the two phenyl protons ortho to the fluorine substituent (positions 3 and 5 on the benzene ring). These protons experience significant deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the fluorine atom. The final singlet at 7.5 ppm integrates to the two remaining phenyl protons at positions 2 and 6, which are ortho to the pyrazole ring and meta to the fluorine. Their relatively higher field position reflects a less deshielded environment compared to the fluorine-adjacent protons. The absence of splitting patterns (e.g., doublets or multiplets) in the aromatic region suggests either rapid rotation about the phenyl-pyrazole bond, averaging coupling interactions, or unresolved coupling constants under the experimental conditions. The integration ratios of the peaks (approximately 1:1:2:2) align with the molecular formula, confirming two pyrazole protons and four phenyl protons. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the substitution pattern on both the pyrazole and phenyl rings, with the iodine and fluorine atoms exerting pronounced deshielding effects on adjacent protons."

The most prominent signals include a triplet at 1.2 ppm (3H, J = 7.0 Hz) and a quartet at 4.1 ppm (2H, J = 7.0 Hz), corresponding to the ethyl ester group (-CH2CH3). The methoxy group (-OCH3) appears as a singlet at 3.8 ppm (3H). Two singlets at 2.3 ppm (3H each) are attributed to the methyl groups attached to the aromatic rings. The aromatic region (6.7–7.2 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks, reflecting the substitution pattern of the two benzene rings. The ring connected to the ethyl chain (c1ccc(Oc2cc(OC)ccc2C)cc1C) shows three distinct signals: a doublet at 7.2 ppm (2H, J = 8.5 Hz) and a singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H), indicating a 1,4-disubstituted pattern with a methyl group at the para position. The second ring (Oc2cc(OC)ccc2C) displays a doublet at 6.8 ppm (2H, J = 8.5 Hz), consistent with a 1,4-disubstituted aromatic system with methoxy and methyl groups. Additionally, the aliphatic region (2.5–3.0 ppm) contains two overlapping triplets (each 2H, J = 7.5 Hz), assigned to the methylene groups (-CH2CH2-) linking the ester and aromatic ring. The integration ratios and splitting patterns align with the molecular formula, confirming the presence of 24 protons. The spectrum’s features collectively validate the proposed structure, with distinct chemical shifts and coupling constants reflecting the electronic environment of each proton set."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C24H23N (SMILES: CC1(C)c2ccccc2N2c3ccccc3C(C)(C)c3cccc1c32). The spectrum displays two prominent regions of interest. First, a sharp, high-intensity singlet appears at approximately 2.5 ppm, which dominates the spectrum. This peak corresponds to the twelve equivalent protons of the two tert-butyl groups (C(CH3)3) attached to the carbazole-derived framework. The chemical shift at 2.5 ppm reflects the deshielding effect of the adjacent aromatic rings and the nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic core, which slightly downfield-shifts these protons compared to typical aliphatic methyl groups (~1.3 ppm). The symmetry of the molecule ensures that all twelve protons are in identical magnetic environments, resulting in a single, intense resonance. Second, a series of smaller, overlapping peaks are observed between 7.0–8.0 ppm, characteristic of aromatic protons. These signals arise from the ten protons distributed across the three benzene rings in the structure. The multiplicity and splitting patterns in this region suggest a combination of ortho- and meta-coupled protons, consistent with the substitution pattern of the carbazole system and the tert-butyl groups. The absence of signals below 6 ppm indicates no aliphatic or olefinic protons are present outside the tert-butyl groups. The spectrum lacks significant peaks in the 3–6 ppm range, confirming the absence of protons on sp3-hybridized carbons adjacent to electronegative atoms (e.g., CH or CH2 groups) or protons on unsaturated carbons. The high resolution of the tert-butyl singlet and the well-defined aromatic signals suggest a rigid, symmetric molecular framework with minimal conformational flexibility. This spectral profile aligns with the proposed structure, where the tert-butyl groups provide steric bulk and the aromatic system contributes to the observed deshielding effects."

The spectrum exhibits a molecular ion peak at m/z 330, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 329 g/mol. The base peak at m/z 171 dominates the spectrum, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. Prominent peaks at m/z 160, 143, and 115 suggest sequential fragmentation pathways, likely involving cleavage of the amide bond and the heterocyclic imidazole ring. The peak at m/z 91, a characteristic fragment for benzyl-type structures, implies the presence of a tropylium ion derived from the aromatic system. Additional peaks at m/z 103, 104, and 117 may arise from rearrangements or losses of small neutral molecules (e.g., CO or HCN) from the parent structure. The fragment at m/z 131 could correspond to a naphthalene-like substructure formed via ring contraction or elimination. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 330 confirms the molecular ion’s stability, while the isotopic pattern at m/z 330 (notably the M+1 peak) aligns with the presence of 21 carbon atoms. The fragmentation pattern reflects the compound’s structural features, including the aromatic amide and imidazole substituents, which are prone to homolytic and heterolytic cleavage under electron ionization. This spectrum provides critical insights into the compound’s structural integrity and fragmentation behavior, supporting its identification as a benzamide derivative with a fused imidazole ring system."

Key observations include: 1. **Aromatic Region (100–150 ppm):** - A prominent peak near **150 ppm** corresponds to the quaternary aromatic carbon directly bonded to the sulfone group (C-SO₂), deshielded by the electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonyl moiety. - Multiple peaks between **120–140 ppm** arise from the remaining aromatic carbons in the benzene ring. These shifts are consistent with substituted aromatic systems, where the sulfone group and ring fusion induce varying deshielding effects. 2. **Aliphatic Region (0–100 ppm):** - A sharp peak near **50 ppm** is attributed to the methylene carbons (**CH₂**) adjacent to the nitrogen atom in the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring. The electronegativity of nitrogen deshields these carbons. - A resonance near **40 ppm** corresponds to the **S-methyl group** (C-SO₂CH₃), shifted downfield due to the sulfone’s inductive effects. - A peak at **~30 ppm** represents the **N-methyl group** (N-CH₃), typical for methyl groups attached to nitrogen. - Additional methylene carbons in the aliphatic ring appear near **20–25 ppm**, reflecting their relatively shielded environments. 3. **Quaternary and Functional Group Carbons:** - No significant peaks are observed above 150 ppm, confirming the absence of carbonyl or highly deshielded sp² carbons beyond the sulfone-adjacent aromatic carbon. - The spectrum lacks signals near 200 ppm, ruling out ketone or aldehyde functionalities. The splitting into discrete peaks reflects the molecule’s symmetry and distinct carbon environments. The sulfone group’s strong electron-withdrawing effect significantly influences the aromatic carbon shifts, while the nitrogen-containing ring introduces characteristic aliphatic resonances. This C-NMR spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, validating the molecular formula and connectivity."

This is consistent with the molecule's structure, which contains a nitrogen atom bonded to two carbon atoms. The absence of a broad O–H stretch confirms the lack of hydroxyl groups. Aromatic C–H stretching vibrations appear as sharp peaks near 3000–3100 cm⁻¹, reflecting the presence of the chlorinated benzene ring. The sp³ C–H stretches from the cyclopropyl and methylene (–CH2–) groups are evident in the 2850–2950 cm⁻¹ range. Notably, the C–Cl bond in the para-chlorophenyl moiety generates a distinct absorption band near 600–800 cm⁻¹, a region typical for carbon-halogen stretching vibrations. The aromatic ring’s C=C stretching modes are visible as multiple peaks between 1400–1600 cm⁻¹, consistent with conjugated double bonds in the benzene ring. Additionally, the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex patterns from C–N stretching vibrations (1000–1300 cm⁻¹) and out-of-plane C–H bending modes of the aromatic system.

The spectrum exhibits several distinct peaks that correlate with the structural features of the molecule. The most prominent peaks appear in the aromatic region (6.5–7.5 ppm), corresponding to the four equivalent protons on the para-substituted benzene ring. These protons split into two doublets due to the asymmetry introduced by the diethylamino substituent (N(CC)CC) and the adjacent amide-linked carbon.

Adjacent to this, a peak at ~150 ppm likely arises from the aromatic carbon bonded to the methoxy group (C-OCH3), where the electronegative oxygen induces downfield shifting. Between 120–140 ppm, multiple peaks represent aromatic carbons in the polycyclic framework. The benzodioxole ring (OCH2O) contributes a distinct resonance near ~100 ppm, typical for acetal-type carbons. Two methoxy groups (-OCH3) are evident as sharp peaks at ~60 ppm, consistent with their aliphatic nature and shielding from adjacent oxygen atoms. The methyl group attached to the nitrogen-containing ring appears as a singlet near ~20 ppm, while the ethyl bridge (-CH2-CH2-) in the central ring system generates peaks in the 20–30 ppm range, reflecting its aliphatic character.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates 1H and 13C chemical shifts for directly bonded proton-carbon pairs, providing critical insights into the molecular structure. The x-axis represents 1H chemical shifts (ppm), spanning ~14 to -2 ppm, while the y-axis represents 13C chemical shifts (ppm), spanning ~200 to 0 ppm. Key spectral features align with the structural motifs in the molecule: 1. **Aromatic Region (1H: 6.5–8.5 ppm; 13C: 120–140 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to the aromatic protons and their attached carbons in the indole and tosyl groups. The indole ring (c2ccccc2) and the tosyl-substituted benzene ring (c1ccc(C)cc1) exhibit characteristic deshielded protons and carbons due to aromatic ring currents. The distribution of peaks reflects the substitution pattern, with the tosyl group’s para-methyl substitution reducing symmetry and creating distinct chemical environments. 2. **Alkene Region (1H: 4.5–6.5 ppm; 13C: 100–150 ppm):** Peaks in this range arise from the allyl group (C=CC) attached to the indole nitrogen. The vinyl protons (CH=CH2) appear as multiplets due to coupling, with corresponding sp2-hybridized carbons in the 13C dimension. The terminal alkene proton (CH2=) typically resonates at higher 1H ppm (~5–6 ppm), while the internal alkene proton (CH=) appears slightly upfield. 3. **Methyl Group (1H: ~2 ppm; 13C: ~20 ppm):** A distinct cross-peak near 2 ppm (1H) and 20 ppm (13C) corresponds to the tosyl group’s methyl substituent (C6H4-CH3). The high symmetry of the methyl group results in a single sharp peak, reflecting equivalent protons and a single carbon environment. 4. **Carboxylic Acid (1H: ~10–12 ppm; 13C: ~170–180 ppm):** The carboxylic acid proton (C(=O)O) appears as a broad peak in the downfield region (1H: ~10–12 ppm), with its attached carbonyl carbon resonating in the 13C dimension (~170–180 ppm). The broadness arises from hydrogen bonding and rapid exchange with solvent protons. 5. **Quaternary Carbons:** Absence of peaks in regions corresponding to quaternary carbons (e.g., carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid, sulfonamide carbon, or aromatic carbons bonded to sulfur) confirms their lack of directly attached protons. This HSQC spectrum effectively maps protonated carbons, aiding in the assignment of the molecule’s structural motifs.

A prominent peak at ~165 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid carbon (C=O), which typically resonates in the downfield region due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen atoms. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~150 ppm is consistent with the carbon in the pyrimidine ring bearing the hydroxyl group (-OH), as electronegative substituents deshield the carbon nucleus. Several peaks in the aromatic region (110–150 ppm) arise from the benzene rings. The benzyl group (OCH2Ph) contributes to peaks at ~128 ppm and ~125 ppm, corresponding to the para-substituted phenyl ring carbons. The aromatic ring substituted with Cl and Br (at positions 4 and 2, respectively) shows peaks at ~135 ppm and ~130 ppm, reflecting the deshielding effects of the halogens.

Key features include: 1. **Carbonyl Region (160–180 ppm):** A prominent peak near 170 ppm corresponds to the ester carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the cyclopentyl ester group (OC1CCCC1). A slightly lower-intensity peak around 165 ppm is attributed to the amide carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the pyrrolidine-fused ring system. These shifts are consistent with sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons in electron-withdrawing environments. 2. **Aromatic Region (120–140 ppm):** Multiple sharp peaks between 125–140 ppm arise from the aromatic carbons in the iodinated benzene ring. The iodine substituent induces significant deshielding, shifting adjacent carbons downfield (e.g., C2 and C6 ortho to iodine near 140 ppm). The remaining aromatic carbons exhibit intermediate shifts (125–135 ppm), reflecting their varied electronic environments. 3. **Aliphatic and Heterocyclic Regions (20–60 ppm):** - A cluster of peaks near 60 ppm corresponds to the oxygen-bearing carbon (CH2) in the cyclopentyl ester group, deshielded by the adjacent ester oxygen. - Peaks between 40–50 ppm are assigned to the pyrrolidine ring carbons (C3a and C6a in the bicyclic system), with the bridgehead carbon (C3a) appearing slightly upfield (~45 ppm) due to ring strain. - The cyclopentyl ring carbons (C2–C5) resonate between 20–35 ppm, with equivalent carbons producing overlapping signals. 4. **Low-Field Signals (<20 ppm):** No significant peaks are observed in the extreme upfield region, confirming the absence of methyl groups or highly shielded aliphatic carbons. The spectrum’s peak multiplicity and intensity distribution align with the molecule’s symmetry and functional group diversity. The iodine atom’s strong electronegativity and heavy-atom effects further influence chemical shifts, particularly in the aromatic and adjacent carbons.

Prominent peaks are observed at m/z 113, 125, 75, 87, 89, and 100, with additional significant signals at 53, 69, and 112. The fragmentation pattern reflects the structural features of the molecule, which contains a cyclic anhydride moiety (O=C-O-C=O) and alkyl substituents. The peak at m/z 99 likely arises from cleavage of the ethyl group (C2H5, 29 Da) from the molecular ion, yielding a C5H5O3+ fragment. The m/z 113 peak may result from loss of a methyl group (CH3, 15 Da) and a carbonyl (CO, 28 Da), while the m/z 125 peak could correspond to retention of the anhydride core with partial alkyl chain fragmentation. Peaks at m/z 75 and 87 suggest further decomposition of the ring system, potentially forming smaller acyclic carbonyl-containing fragments. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms in the molecule is reflected in the prevalence of oxygen-rich fragment ions, such as those at m/z 89 (C4H5O2+) and 100 (C5H4O2+). The spectrum’s complexity highlights the molecule’s propensity for both homolytic and heterolytic bond cleavage under electron ionization, with the anhydride ring structure contributing to diverse fragmentation pathways.

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H8ClFN2O2 (SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1nc2cc(F)ccc2nc1Cl). The spectrum displays a dominant molecular ion peak at m/z 255, corresponding to the intact molecular ion [M]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of the compound. The base peak at m/z 255 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Notable fragment ions are observed at m/z 227, 209, 183, 181, 172, 149, 147, 135, and 94. The peak at m/z 227 suggests a loss of 28 Da from the molecular ion, likely attributed to the cleavage of the ethoxy group (C2H4, 28.0 Da) from the ester moiety, forming a [M − C2H4]+ fragment. The subsequent peak at m/z 209 represents a further loss of 18 Da (H2O), consistent with dehydration of the intermediate fragment. The peaks at m/z 183 and 181 correspond to the core quinoxaline structure (C8H4ClFN2) with chlorine isotopic contributions: 181 (35Cl) and 183 (37Cl), reflecting the natural abundance ratio of chlorine isotopes (~3:1). Additional fragments include m/z 172, which may arise from the loss of CO (28 Da) from the m/z 200 ion (though not directly observed), and m/z 147/149, likely representing the [C8H4FN2]+ fragment with and without chlorine isotopes. The peak at m/z 135 could correspond to a benzoxazole-derived fragment (C7H3ClFN2), while m/z 94 may originate from a fluorinated benzene ring (C6H3F). The spectrum highlights characteristic fragmentation patterns of the quinoxaline core and ester functionality, with chlorine isotopes providing diagnostic confirmation of the molecular structure. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 90 suggests minimal further degradation of the aromatic system under the experimental conditions."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C13H8FNO2S (SMILES: O=C1Cc2c(F)cc(C(=O)c3cccs3)cc2N1). The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances characteristic of aromatic, carbonyl, and heteroatom-substituted environments. The most prominent peak appears at approximately 190 ppm, corresponding to the ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the thioester group (C(=O)c3cccs3), which typically resonates in the 180–200 ppm range due to the deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen. A second high-field carbonyl signal near 170 ppm likely arises from the amide carbonyl (O=C1C), which is slightly shielded compared to the ketone due to resonance stabilization with the adjacent nitrogen. Aromatic carbons dominate the 120–160 ppm region, with multiple peaks reflecting the substituted benzene ring (c2c(F)cc...cc2). The fluorine substituent at position 2 induces a downfield shift in adjacent carbons, particularly the ipso carbon (directly bonded to F), which may appear near 160 ppm. The remaining aromatic carbons exhibit shifts between 120–140 ppm, consistent with electron-withdrawing effects from both the fluorine and carbonyl groups. The thiophene ring (c3cccs3) contributes peaks in the 120–130 ppm range, typical for heteroaromatic carbons. A methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the amide nitrogen (C1C) is evident as a distinct peak near 40 ppm, reflecting its aliphatic character. The absence of signals below 30 ppm confirms the lack of alkyl groups beyond this CH2 moiety. The spectrum’s overall pattern aligns with the proposed structure, demonstrating clear differentiation between carbonyl, aromatic, and aliphatic carbons. No spurious peaks are observed, indicating high sample purity. This C-NMR data effectively corroborates the molecular framework of C13H8FNO2S, with chemical shifts and intensities consistent with the described functional groups and substitution pattern."

The spectrum displays several prominent peaks that correspond to characteristic fragmentation patterns of the molecule. The base peak at m/z 244 represents the most abundant fragment, likely resulting from cleavage of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group (C5H9O2) from the parent molecule, leaving a sulfonamide-containing fragment. A significant peak at m/z 388 corresponds to the molecular ion (M+), confirming the molecular weight of 388 g/mol calculated from the formula. Notable isotopic patterns are observed due to the presence of chlorine and fluorine atoms. The peak pairs at m/z 180/182 (relative intensity ~3:1) and 313/315 (relative intensity ~3:1) reflect the natural abundance of chlorine isotopes (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl), consistent with the molecule’s monochlorinated structure. The fluorine atom contributes to the distinct mass shifts in fragments containing the fluorinated quinoline moiety (e.g., m/z 313, 344). Additional peaks at m/z 99 and 100 correspond to the Boc group (C4H9O2⁺) and its isotopic variant, respectively. The fragment at m/z 344 likely arises from the loss of a methyl group (CH3) from the molecular ion, while the peak at m/z 277 may represent a fragment retaining the sulfonamide and quinoline groups after cleavage of the pyrrolidine ring. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 388 confirms the molecular ion as the highest mass species detected. These spectral features align with the structural features of the molecule, including the Boc-protected amine, sulfonamide linkage, and halogenated aromatic system. The fragmentation pattern provides insights into the stability of the sulfonamide and Boc groups under ionization conditions, with the base peak indicating preferential cleavage at the Boc-amine bond. The isotopic signatures further validate the presence of chlorine and fluorine, while the molecular ion peak confirms the compound’s molecular weight. This analysis demonstrates the utility of mass spectrometry in elucidating structural motifs and verifying molecular composition."

Key observations include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6.0–8.0 ppm):** - A singlet at ~7.0 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent aromatic protons on the para-substituted methoxyphenyl ring (positions 3 and 5 of the phenyl group). - Two doublets at ~6.8 ppm and ~6.0 ppm (each integrating to 1H) arise from the pyrrole ring protons at positions 4 and 5, respectively, exhibiting mutual coupling. 2. **Aliphatic Region (1.0–4.5 ppm):** - A triplet at ~4.2 ppm (2H) and a quartet at ~1.2 ppm (3H) are characteristic of the ethyl ester group (-CH2CH3), with the CH2 adjacent to the ester oxygen and the CH3 terminal methyl. - A singlet at ~3.8 ppm (3H) corresponds to the methoxy (-OCH3) substituent on the phenyl ring. - A singlet at ~2.5 ppm (3H) is assigned to the methyl group (-CH3) at position 2 of the pyrrole ring. 3. **Low-Field Region (10–12 ppm):** - Peaks at ~10.5 ppm and ~10.2 ppm are likely residual solvent signals (e.g., DMSO-d6 or water) or impurities, as no acidic protons (e.g., -OH or -NH) are present in the structure. The spectrum confirms the molecular structure through distinct chemical shifts and splitting patterns. The integration ratios (not explicitly shown) would further validate the proton counts for each environment. This H-NMR data aligns with the expected electronic effects of substituents: deshielded aromatic protons, shielded aliphatic groups, and the electron-withdrawing ester and methoxy functionalities influencing resonance positions."

The spectrum displays key correlations between directly bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms, enabling structural analysis. The aldehyde proton (O=CH-) appears as a prominent cross-peak at approximately 10 ppm (¹H) and 200 ppm (¹³C), consistent with the deshielded nature of the formyl group. Adjacent to this, a cluster of peaks in the aliphatic region (¹H: 1–2 ppm; ¹³C: 20–30 ppm) corresponds to the five methylene (CH₂) groups in the hexyl chain (positions 2–6 of the aliphatic segment). The terminal methylene group directly bonded to oxygen (O-CH₂-) is observed at ~3.5 ppm (¹H) and ~65 ppm (¹³C), reflecting the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen atom. In the aromatic region, two distinct cross-peaks are visible: one at ~7.5 ppm (¹H) and ~130 ppm (¹³C), and another at ~7.2 ppm (¹H) and ~125 ppm (¹³C). These correspond to the two sets of equivalent aromatic protons and their attached carbons on the para-substituted benzene ring. The chlorine substituent at position 4 and the oxygen-linked carbon at position 1 create an asymmetric environment, splitting the aromatic signals into two pairs (H-3/H-5 and H-2/H-6). The absence of correlations for quaternary carbons (e.g., the chlorine-bearing carbon at position 4 and the oxygen-linked carbon at position 1) is expected in HSQC, as these carbons lack directly attached hydrogens. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of an aldehyde, a hexyl chain, an ether linkage, and a monochlorinated aromatic ring. The chemical shifts and coupling patterns provide clear evidence for the molecular framework defined by the SMILES notation."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C9H13NO2S (SMILES: Cc1ccc(N(C)S(C)(=O)=O)cc1). The spectrum displays four distinct peaks, each corresponding to specific proton environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak, located near 10 ppm, is highly deshielded and likely represents aromatic protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing sulfonamide group (-S(=O)₂-). This group withdraws electron density via inductive effects, significantly deshielding nearby protons. The two equivalent aromatic protons ortho to the sulfonamide substituent typically resonate in this region, appearing as a singlet due to symmetry in the para-substituted benzene ring. Adjacent to this, a peak at approximately 5 ppm corresponds to the remaining two aromatic protons ortho to the methyl group (-CH₃) on the benzene ring. These protons are less deshielded compared to those near the sulfonamide group, as the methyl group is electron-donating and exerts a shielding effect. The splitting pattern here is not resolved in the spectrum, suggesting possible overlap or rapid relaxation effects. A sharp peak at 4.5 ppm is attributed to the N-methyl group (-N-CH₃) attached to the sulfonamide nitrogen. This environment is moderately deshielded due to the electronegativity of the adjacent nitrogen and sulfur atoms. Finally, the upfield peak at 2.5 ppm corresponds to the aromatic methyl group (-C-CH₃) on the benzene ring. Methyl groups directly bonded to aromatic systems typically resonate in the 2.0–2.5 ppm range due to ring current effects and partial shielding. The integration of these peaks aligns with the molecular formula: the aromatic region (10 ppm and 5 ppm) accounts for four protons (two sets of equivalent protons), while the methyl groups (4.5 ppm and 2.5 ppm) integrate to six protons total (two methyl groups of three protons each). The absence of additional peaks confirms the symmetry of the molecule and the lack of coupling between non-equivalent protons in this simplified spectrum. This analysis supports the proposed structure, where the para-substitution pattern on the benzene ring creates distinct electronic environments for the observed proton signals."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C13H16O (SMILES: O=CC1(c2ccccc2)CCCCC1). The spectrum displays three distinct regions of cross-peaks, corresponding to correlations between proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts for directly bonded pairs. 1. **Aldehyde Region**: A prominent cross-peak is observed at approximately 10 ppm (¹H) and 190 ppm (¹³C), characteristic of the aldehyde functional group (CHO). This signal arises from the proton of the formyl group directly attached to the sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbon. The high ¹³C shift reflects the deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen atom in the carbonyl group. 2. **Aromatic Region**: Multiple cross-peaks cluster between 6.5–8 ppm (¹H) and 120–140 ppm (¹³C), consistent with the aromatic protons and their attached carbons in the phenyl ring (c2ccccc2). The dispersion of these peaks reflects the non-equivalent chemical environments of the aromatic protons due to the substitution pattern on the cyclohexane ring. These signals confirm the presence of a monosubstituted benzene ring, where the substituent (the cyclohexane-aldehyde group) induces slight asymmetry in the aromatic system. 3. **Aliphatic Region**: A single cross-peak appears near 1.5 ppm (¹H) and 30 ppm (¹³C), corresponding to the methylene (CH₂) groups in the cyclohexane ring. The relatively uniform chemical shift for these protons and carbons suggests that the cyclohexane adopts a conformation where the CH₂ groups experience similar electronic environments, likely due to rapid ring flipping in solution. The absence of additional peaks in this region indicates that all five CH₂ groups in the cyclohexane are chemically equivalent on the NMR timescale. Notably, no cross-peaks are observed for the quaternary carbon (C1 of the cyclohexane ring), which bears both the aldehyde and phenyl substituents, as this carbon lacks directly attached protons. The HSQC data aligns with the proposed structure, confirming the connectivity of the aldehyde, aromatic, and cyclohexane moieties. The spectrum provides direct evidence for the molecular framework, supporting the assigned formula and SMILES notation."

A broad, moderate-intensity band near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to N–H stretching vibrations from the primary amine (NCC1) and secondary amide (C(N)=O) groups. Sharp peaks in the 3500–3600 cm⁻¹ region may further indicate isolated N–H stretches, though their resolution is limited in this spectrum. A prominent sharp peak at ~1650 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the amide group, which is typically observed in this region. The absence of a stronger absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests no significant contribution from ketone or carboxylic acid carbonyls, aligning with the molecular structure. Additional peaks between 1450–1600 cm⁻¹ likely arise from aromatic C=C stretching vibrations in the substituted phenyl rings (c3ccc(Oc4ccccc4)cc3), while a distinct band near 1250 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C–O–C asymmetric stretching in the ether linkage (Oc4ccccc4). The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) displays multiple sharp peaks, including those near 1000–1100 cm⁻¹, which could be attributed to C–N stretching in the amine and amide moieties, as well as deformations in the heterocyclic ring system (nn2C1). Weak absorptions below 900 cm⁻¹ may reflect out-of-plane C–H bending in the aromatic rings. Notably, the lack of broad O–H stretching near 2500–3300 cm⁻¹ confirms the absence of hydroxyl groups, consistent with the molecular formula. Overall, the IR spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting key functional groups such as amide, amine, ether, and aromatic systems.

Several fragment ions are observed. A prominent peak at m/z 356 suggests loss of a neutral fragment with a mass of 20 Da, consistent with the elimination of hydrogen fluoride (HF) from the trifluoromethyl group (–CF₂–). This is a common fragmentation pathway for fluorinated compounds. A secondary fragment at m/z 297 corresponds to the loss of bromine (Br•) as a radical, leaving a stable aromatic fragment ion.

The spectrum displays four distinct proton resonances, consistent with the molecular structure. The most prominent peak at approximately 7.0 ppm corresponds to the two aromatic protons on the benzene ring. These protons appear as a singlet, indicating symmetry in their electronic environment, likely due to the para-arrangement of the amino (-NH2) and thioether (-SC[N+](=O)[O-]) substituents. The chemical shift of 7.0 ppm is typical for aromatic protons in electron-rich systems, where the amino group donates electron density to the ring. A sharp peak at ~4.2 ppm represents the two protons of the -CH2- group adjacent to the sulfur atom in the thioether linkage. This signal is deshielded due to the electronegativity of sulfur and the adjacent nitro group (-NO2), which withdraws electron density through induction. The chemical shift aligns with expectations for a methylene group bonded to heteroatoms. Two upfield signals at ~2.3 ppm and ~1.8 ppm correspond to the two methyl (-CH3) groups attached to the benzene ring. These peaks appear as singlets, reflecting their equivalence in the molecular symmetry. The chemical shifts are consistent with aromatic methyl groups, which are shielded relative to aliphatic protons but slightly deshielded compared to isolated alkyl groups due to their attachment to the aromatic system. The absence of additional peaks in the spectrum suggests that the amino (-NH2) protons are either exchange-broadened (due to hydrogen bonding or solvent interactions) or obscured by the baseline. The nitro group (-NO2) does not contribute to proton signals, as it lacks hydrogen atoms. Integration of the peaks (not explicitly shown but inferred from intensity) supports the molecular formula: the aromatic (2H), methylene (2H), and methyl (6H) signals account for all 12 protons in C9H12N2O2S. The spectrum confirms the proposed structure, with no evidence of impurities or unexpected functional groups."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates 1H and 13C chemical shifts for directly bonded proton-carbon pairs, providing insights into the molecular structure. The 1H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans ~14 to -2 ppm, while the 13C axis (y-axis) ranges from ~0 to 200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Methyl ester group (CO2CH3):** A distinct cross-peak at ~3.7 ppm (1H) and ~52 ppm (13C) corresponds to the methoxy protons and carbon of the methyl ester.

The upfield proton shift and moderate 13C shift reflect the aliphatic nature of this moiety. 3. **Ring CH2 groups:** Peaks at ~2.5–3.5 ppm (1H) and ~35–45 ppm (13C) correspond to methylene (CH2) groups in the pyrrolidine ring. The protons adjacent to the nitrogen (CH2-N) appear slightly downfield (~3.2 ppm, ~45 ppm), while those near the ketone (CH2-C=O) are more shielded (~2.5 ppm, ~35 ppm), consistent with their electronic environments. 4. **Carbonyl carbons:** No cross-peaks are observed for the carbonyl carbons (ester, Boc, and ketone groups) as they lack directly attached protons, which is typical for HSQC spectra. The spectrum confirms the presence of key functional groups: a methyl ester, Boc-protected amine, and cyclic ketone. The resolved cross-peaks allow assignment of protonated carbons, validating the structural features of the molecule. The absence of signals for quaternary carbons (e.g., carbonyls, Boc quaternary carbon) aligns with HSQC's sensitivity to only 1H-13C pairs. This analysis supports the molecular formula and SMILES provided, illustrating the utility of HSQC in elucidating connectivity in complex organic molecules."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 464, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 463.55 g/mol for C26H30FN5O2. The base peak (highest relative abundance) appears at m/z 200, indicating a highly stable fragment ion, likely arising from cleavage of the molecule’s central urea or piperidine ring. Notable fragment ions include peaks at m/z 198, 226, 253, 406, and 444. The m/z 198 peak may represent a loss of 266 Da from the parent ion, potentially corresponding to the elimination of a phenylindazole moiety (C15H12N3) and a fluorine atom. The m/z 226 fragment could result from a retro-Diels-Alder cleavage of the indazole ring system, retaining a substituted pyrazole fragment. The peak at m/z 253 suggests a loss of 211 Da, possibly involving the COCCN group and part of the piperidine ring. Lower-intensity peaks at m/z 108, 144, 148, and 162–163 are consistent with smaller aromatic or aliphatic fragments, such as phenyl (C6H5, m/z 77) or indazole-derived ions (e.g., C7H5N2, m/z 117). The presence of fluorine is reflected in the absence of significant isotope peaks, as fluorine-19 lacks natural isotopic abundance. The peak at m/z 406 (M+ – 58) may correspond to the loss of a CO2H group or a butyl fragment, while m/z 444 (M+ – 20) could indicate the elimination of HF. These fragmentation patterns are consistent with the molecule’s structural features, including the indazole core, urea linkage, and fluorinated piperidine ring. The spectrum highlights the molecule’s stability under ionization conditions, with key cleavages occurring at the urea and heterocyclic bonds, providing insights into its structural motifs."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 14–0 ppm, corresponding to different proton environments in the molecule. A prominent singlet at ~13 ppm (intensity ~0.175) is characteristic of a strongly deshielded proton, likely the NH proton of the urea moiety (NC(=O)NC(=O)) involved in hydrogen bonding. A second singlet at ~10 ppm (intensity ~0.15) may correspond to another NH proton in a similar environment. Aromatic protons from the pyridine and pyrazole rings appear as multiplets between 8–6 ppm (intensity ~0.075–0.1), consistent with their deshielded nature and coupling interactions. A sharp singlet at ~4 ppm (intensity ~0.05) suggests a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative oxygen atom (e.g., the OCH2 group in the ether linkage). Peaks at ~2 ppm (intensity ~0.025–0.05) likely arise from aliphatic protons in the cyclopentane ring (C2CCOC2) and the methyl group attached to the pyridine ring (Cc1nc...).

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption features consistent with the functional groups present in the molecule. A broad, strong absorption band centered near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O-H stretching vibration, likely originating from the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the structure. This band is typically broad due to hydrogen bonding. Sharp, intense peaks observed around 1700 cm⁻¹ are indicative of carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibrations. The higher-frequency peak near 1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carboxylic acid carbonyl, while the slightly lower-frequency peak near 1680 cm⁻¹ may arise from the lactam (cyclic amide) carbonyl in the benzimidazole ring system. Additional features in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) include multiple sharp peaks between 1200–1300 cm⁻¹, which are consistent with C-O stretching vibrations from the methoxy (-OCH₃) substituent and the carboxylic acid group. The aromatic C-H in-plane bending vibrations appear as weaker peaks near 1450–1600 cm⁻¹, aligning with the fluorinated benzene ring in the structure. The C-F stretching vibration, expected in the range of 1000–1300 cm⁻¹, may contribute to the complex absorption patterns observed in this region. The absence of significant absorption above 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests minimal interference from free hydroxyl groups or amines, while the lack of peaks near 2200 cm⁻¹ confirms the absence of nitriles or alkynes. The overall spectral profile aligns with the molecular structure, providing evidence for the functional groups described by the SMILES notation. This analysis highlights the utility of IR spectroscopy in identifying key vibrational modes associated with the molecule’s functional groups."

The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances that correlate with the structural features of the compound. The most prominent peak at 2.6 ppm (singlet, ~6H) corresponds to the geminal dimethyl groups (C(CH3)2) in the 1,2-oxazolidinone ring, which are deshielded by proximity to the electronegative oxygen and carbonyl group. A sharp singlet at 1.4 ppm (~9H) arises from the tert-butyl group of the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group, a common feature in carbamate derivatives. In the aromatic region, two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 6.8 ppm (~1H each) indicate two non-equivalent aromatic protons on the chlorinated benzene ring. The substitution pattern (para to the CH2N group and ortho to the Cl atom) creates a desymmetrized environment, splitting these protons into distinct signals. A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (~1H) is attributed to the Boc-protected amine (NH), which is strongly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding or solvent effects. A resonance at 4.6 ppm (~2H) corresponds to the methylene group (CH2) linking the benzene ring to the 1,2-oxazolidinone nitrogen. This signal is shifted downfield due to its attachment to both an aromatic system and an electron-withdrawing nitrogen. The absence of peaks above 12 ppm rules out carboxylic acid or aldehyde protons, while the lack of signals between 3–5 ppm confirms no additional oxygenated or nitrogenated aliphatic protons are present. The integration and splitting patterns align with the molecular formula, accounting for all 23 protons: 9 (Boc), 6 (geminal dimethyl), 2 (CH2), 1 (NH), and 3 aromatic protons (with two observed due to symmetry or overlap). This spectrum provides clear evidence of the compound’s structural motifs, including the Boc-protected amine, substituted aromatic ring, and 1,2-oxazolidinone heterocycle."

The base peak (highest relative abundance) appears at m/z 131, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. Prominent peaks at m/z 160, 146, 102, and 77 further characterize the fragmentation pattern. The molecular ion (m/z 188) confirms the molecular formula C11H9NO2. The peak at m/z 160 represents a loss of 28 Da (likely CO or C2H4), suggesting cleavage of a carbonyl-containing fragment. The base peak at m/z 131 corresponds to a phthalimide-derived fragment, consistent with the structure of the molecule, where the N-allyl group is lost, leaving the aromatic dicarboximide core. The peak at m/z 146 may arise from the loss of the allyl group (C3H5, 41 Da) from the molecular ion, yielding a phthalimide anion (C8H4NO2, 146 Da). Additional peaks at m/z 115, 116, and 118 are characteristic of the phthalimide ring system, reflecting partial fragmentation of the aromatic and carbonyl components. The peak at m/z 102 suggests a tropylium ion or a substituted aromatic fragment, while the peak at m/z 77 corresponds to a phenyl cation (C6H5+), a common fragment in aromatic compounds. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 188 confirms the molecular ion is the parent species. This fragmentation pattern aligns with the structure of C=CCN1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, where the phthalimide ring and allyl substituent undergo predictable cleavage under electron ionization.

The spectrum displays a dominant peak at m/z 325, which corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]⁺, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 324 g/mol for C17H16N4OS. The base peak at m/z 325 indicates high stability of the protonated molecule under the ionization conditions. Notable fragment peaks are observed at m/z 282, 283, 266, 252, 307, 308, and 105. The peak at m/z 282 (relative abundance ~40%) likely arises from the loss of a neutral fragment, such as a CH₂N group (mass difference of 29), from the [M+H]⁺ ion. The adjacent peak at m/z 283 may represent an isotopic variant or a secondary fragmentation pathway. The cluster of peaks between m/z 252–283 suggests cleavage of the thiazole ring system (C₃H₂NS) or the pyridine substituent (C₅H₄N), which are structural features of the molecule. For instance, the peak at m/z 266 could correspond to the retention of the core bicyclic system (C₁₂H₁₂N₂O) after loss of the thiazole-pyridine moiety (C₅H₄N₂S, calculated mass 148). The peak at m/z 105 (relative abundance ~10%) is indicative of a smaller, stable fragment, potentially derived from the pyridine-thiazole substructure. This fragment may retain the pyridine ring (C₅H₄N, mass 78) along with a sulfur-containing group (e.g., CH₂S, mass 46), though further analysis would be required for definitive assignment. The peaks at m/z 307 and 308 (relative abundance ~15% and 20%, respectively) may result from partial degradation of the bicyclic core, such as the loss of a methyl group (CH₃, mass 15) or a hydroxyl radical (OH, mass 17) from the [M+H]⁺ ion. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 100 suggests limited fragmentation of the heterocyclic rings under the experimental conditions. The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural complexity of the molecule, particularly the presence of labile bonds in the thiazole and pyridine rings, as well as the susceptibility of the bicyclic core to cleavage. The spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule’s stability and fragmentation behavior, which are essential for structural elucidation and identification in analytical applications."

A broad, moderately intense peak near 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of N-H stretching vibrations, though this may also overlap with residual moisture or sample impurities. Sharp, intense peaks around 3000–3100 cm⁻¹ correspond to aromatic C-H stretching vibrations from the pyridine and fluorophenyl rings, while weaker aliphatic C-H stretches from the ethyl groups (CCN(CC)) appear near 2850–2950 cm⁻¹. The region between 1600–1500 cm⁻¹ shows multiple medium-to-strong peaks, indicative of C=C stretching in aromatic systems, particularly from the fused pyridine and phenyl rings. A prominent band near 1350 cm⁻¹ may arise from C-N stretching in the tertiary amine (CCN(CC)) or pyridine ring. The sharp peak at ~1000 cm⁻¹ aligns with C-F stretching vibrations from the 4-fluorophenyl substituent. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) exhibits complex, overlapping absorptions due to out-of-plane C-H bending, ring deformations, and other skeletal vibrations, which are typical for polycyclic aromatic systems.

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H15N3O3 (SMILES: COC(=O)c1cnc(NC(=O)C(C)(C)C)cn1). The spectrum reveals three distinct cross-peaks, each corresponding to direct correlations between proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) nuclei within the molecule. The most downfield proton signal appears at approximately 12.5 ppm, coupled to a carbon resonance at ~175 ppm. This suggests a proton directly bonded to a carbonyl carbon, which is unusual for this structure but may indicate an artifact or a deshielded environment, such as a proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. The second cross-peak, located at ~6 ppm (¹H) and ~50 ppm (¹³C), corresponds to the methoxy group (-OCH₃) of the ester moiety. The chemical shift of the proton is slightly downfield compared to typical aliphatic methoxy groups, likely due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carbonyl. The third cross-peak at ~8.5 ppm (¹H) and ~150 ppm (¹³C) arises from the aromatic protons on the pyrazine ring. These protons are deshielded due to the electron-deficient nature of the heteroaromatic system, and their carbon counterparts are also downfield-shifted, consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons in a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring. Notably, the tert-butyl group (C(CH₃)₃) does not produce a visible cross-peak in this spectrum, likely because its protons (~1.2 ppm) are either not resolved or fall outside the plotted range. The observed features align with the molecular framework, highlighting the ester, amide, and pyrazine functionalities, though the high-field carbon resonance at 175 ppm warrants further validation to confirm its origin."

The spectrum displays a molecular ion peak at m/z 352, corresponding to the intact molecule, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 351.37 g/mol (C18H20F3N3O). The base peak at m/z 177, the most intense signal, suggests a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the amide bond (C=O) adjacent to the piperidine ring, retaining the substituted pyrazole moiety (c2c(C(F)F)nn(C)c2F) and part of the heterocyclic structure. Prominent peaks at m/z 174 and 248 indicate additional fragmentation pathways. The m/z 174 peak may correspond to a fragment retaining the pyrazole ring and a portion of the piperidine, while m/z 248 could represent a larger fragment resulting from the loss of the tolyl group (C7H7) from the molecular ion. Smaller peaks at m/z 105, 119, 127, 131, and 151 suggest further breakdown of the aromatic and aliphatic regions, with m/z 105 potentially reflecting a methyl-substituted benzyl cation (C7H7+) and m/z 151 indicative of a pyrazole-derived fragment. The presence of fluorine atoms (F3) is consistent with the absence of significant isotope patterns, as fluorine-19 is monoisotopic. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern highlights the stability of the pyrazole and piperidine rings under electron ionization, with the molecular ion’s cleavage favoring retention of electron-rich heterocyclic components. These observations align with the structural features of the compound, including the amide linkage and fluorinated substituents, which influence both the stability and fragmentation behavior of the molecule."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of hydrogen atoms in the molecule. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at ~6 ppm, corresponding to the aromatic protons of the pyridine ring (c2ccncc2) and the fused quinazolinone core (c2ncc(=O)n...c2c1). These protons experience deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing effects of adjacent nitrogen atoms and the carbonyl group. A smaller multiplet near ~7 ppm likely arises from coupling between aromatic protons on the methoxy-substituted benzene ring (COc1cc(-c2ccncc2)...c1). A high-intensity singlet at ~3 ppm is attributed to the three equivalent protons of the methoxy group (OCH3), which are shielded by the electron-donating oxygen atom. Adjacent to this, a triplet at ~2.5 ppm integrates to two protons, assignable to the CH2 group in the ethyl linker (CCN3CCC(N)CC3), split by neighboring protons. In the downfield region (~10–12 ppm), two broad singlets are observed. The peak at ~12 ppm corresponds to the amide proton (ncc(=O)n...), strongly deshielded by hydrogen bonding and the carbonyl group. The peak at ~10 ppm likely represents the secondary amine proton (NH) in the piperazine ring (CCC(N)CC3), which may exhibit variable chemical shifts due to proton exchange or solvent interactions. Additional multiplets in the 1.5–4 ppm range reflect the complex splitting patterns of the piperazine ring’s CH2 groups, influenced by their proximity to the nitrogen atoms and the ethyl chain. The absence of signals below 0 ppm or above 14 ppm confirms no highly acidic or aromatic protons are present beyond the described environments. This spectrum aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including aromatic heterocycles, a methoxy substituent, and aliphatic amines, providing insights into its electronic and conformational properties."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks corresponding to the proton environments in the molecule. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at approximately 3.0 ppm, which is characteristic of the two protons from the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the indole nitrogen. This signal is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the neighboring carbonyl group (C=O) and aromatic system. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the complex splitting patterns of protons on the substituted benzene and indole rings. The multiplet near 7.0–7.5 ppm likely corresponds to the protons on the benzamide moiety (N-C(=O)-c6H5), while the peaks at ~6.8 ppm and ~8.0 ppm may arise from the fluorinated benzene ring (with fluorine causing deshielding and splitting via spin-spin coupling) and the indole ring protons, respectively. The fluorine atom at the para position of the benzene ring (cc1cc1F) introduces a distinct splitting pattern, potentially observable as a doublet or multiplet due to ¹⁹F-¹H coupling. A singlet at ~11.0 ppm is consistent with the indole NH proton, which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the aromatic ring current. Additionally, a broad peak near 10.5 ppm may correspond to the amide NH proton (N-C(=O)-), though its exact position can vary depending on hydrogen bonding and solvent effects. The tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) attached to the indole ring appears as a singlet at ~1.3 ppm, reflecting the equivalent methyl protons in a shielded environment. The methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to the benzene ring is expected to produce a singlet near 3.8 ppm, though it may overlap with the methylene signal at 3.0 ppm or appear as a minor peak in this region. The absence of significant peaks below 2 ppm (excluding the tert-butyl signal) suggests minimal aliphatic substitution beyond the described groups. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, with key features attributable to the aromatic systems, NH protons, methylene, tert-butyl, and methoxy groups. The chemical shifts and splitting patterns provide insights into the electronic environment and connectivity of the molecule’s functional groups."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the bicyclic structure. The most prominent features include a sharp, high-intensity peak at ~50 ppm, a cluster of medium-intensity signals between 20–40 ppm, and a series of peaks in the 120–130 ppm range. Additionally, two distinct signals appear near 170 ppm. The peak at ~50 ppm corresponds to the quaternary carbon (C1) attached to the dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2), which experiences deshielding due to the electronegative nitrogen. The aliphatic region (20–40 ppm) contains multiple resonances, likely from the CH2 groups in the cyclohexene ring (C4, C5, C7, C8) and the bridgehead carbons (C9, C10), which exhibit moderate shielding typical of sp³-hybridized carbons. The peaks in the 120–130 ppm range arise from the alkene carbons (C2, C3) in the unsaturated six-membered ring, consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons in a conjugated system. The two signals near 170 ppm are characteristic of the carbonyl carbons (C11, C12) in the imide moiety (C(=O)NC(=O)), where the high electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen and nitrogen atoms causes significant deshielding. The absence of peaks beyond 200 ppm confirms the lack of aldehyde or ketone functionalities outside the imide group. The symmetry of the bicyclic system likely reduces the number of distinct resonances, as equivalent carbons (e.g., C4/C8, C5/C7) may overlap. The spectrum’s features align with the proposed structure, validating the presence of both sp³ and sp² carbons, as well as the imide and tertiary amine groups. This analysis underscores the utility of C-NMR in resolving complex molecular frameworks through chemical shift dispersion and peak integration."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak near 0 ppm corresponds to the highly shielded methyl carbons (CH3) of the ethyl ester groups, which are typically observed in this region due to their electron-rich aliphatic nature. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~15 ppm arises from the methyl group attached to the thiophene ring, consistent with its slightly deshielded position due to proximity to the aromatic system. A sharp signal at ~60 ppm is attributed to the methylene carbons (OCH2) of the ethyl ester moieties, which experience moderate deshielding from the adjacent oxygen atoms. The spectrum also exhibits a cluster of peaks between 100–150 ppm, characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbons in aromatic and vinylic environments. Specifically, the peak at ~110 ppm corresponds to the thiophene ring carbons, while the signal at ~130 ppm reflects the vinylic carbon directly bonded to the nitrogen atom (C=CN), which is deshielded by the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitrogen. The peak at ~150 ppm likely represents the thiophene carbon adjacent to the sulfur atom, which is further deshielded by the electronegative heteroatom. The most downfield peak at ~170 ppm is assigned to the carbonyl carbons (C=O) of the ester and carboxylic acid groups. These signals appear at high chemical shifts due to the strong deshielding effect of the oxygen atoms in the carbonyl functional groups. The carboxylic acid carbon (C(=O)O) typically resonates slightly downfield compared to ester carbonyls, contributing to the intensity of this peak. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including aliphatic ester groups, a thiophene aromatic system, and conjugated vinylic and carbonyl functionalities. The integration of peak intensities and chemical shifts provides a comprehensive overview of the carbon framework in this compound."

A resonance near 40 ppm may arise from the CH group adjacent to the carboxylic acid functionality. 2. **Aromatic region (100–160 ppm):** Multiple sharp peaks in this range reflect the aromatic carbons of the biphenyl and pyrrole moieties. The most downfield aromatic signal (~155 ppm) likely corresponds to the carbon directly bonded to the nitrile group (-C≡N) on the phenyl ring, while other aromatic carbons appear between 120–140 ppm due to varying electronic environments. 3. **Carbonyl resonance (~170 ppm):** A strong peak near 170 ppm is consistent with the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (C=O), a hallmark of the -COOH group. 4. **Nitrile carbon (~115 ppm):** A distinct peak around 115 ppm aligns with the sp-hybridized carbon of the nitrile group (-C≡N). 5. **Pyrrole ring carbons:** The pyrrole ring (5-membered aromatic ring with nitrogen) contributes to peaks between 100–130 ppm, with the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen (C2 position) typically appearing downfield (~125 ppm) due to deshielding effects. The spectrum’s peak distribution and intensities correlate with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of aliphatic, aromatic, carbonyl, and nitrile functionalities. The absence of peaks beyond 200 ppm rules out ketones or aldehydes, while the lack of signals below 10 ppm excludes highly shielded methyl groups.

The spectrum exhibits a molecular ion peak at m/z 466, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. The base peak at m/z 317 indicates a stable brominated fragment, consistent with the presence of bromine (Br) in the structure. Isotopic patterns are evident, including a prominent M+2 peak at m/z 319, reflecting the natural abundance ratio of bromine isotopes (⁷⁹Br/⁸¹Br ≈ 1:1). Additional peaks at m/z 381, 382, and 383 suggest fragmentation retaining both bromine and sulfur atoms, with the 381/383 doublet further confirming bromine's isotopic signature. Lower m/z fragments include peaks at 170, 186, and 187, likely representing cleavage of the sulfonamide (S(=O)₂NH) or heterocyclic moieties. The m/z 238 peak may correspond to a fragment involving the oxazole ring (C₅H₄N₂O) and adjacent substituents. Peaks at 305 and 318 could arise from partial loss of the cyclopentyl group (C₅H₉) or rearrangement processes.

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups present in the molecule. A broad, moderate-intensity band near 3300 cm⁻¹ is consistent with N–H stretching vibrations from the secondary amide group (NC(=O)c3cccc(Cl)c3). Two strong, sharp peaks at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ correspond to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibrations of the cyclic imide moiety (O=C1CC(=O)N...) and the aromatic amide, respectively. The splitting of these carbonyl bands reflects the distinct electronic environments of the two carbonyl groups. In the fingerprint region (1500–500 cm⁻¹), multiple peaks arise from C–N stretching vibrations (e.g., ~1300 cm⁻¹ and ~1200 cm⁻¹) and aromatic C=C ring deformations (~1500 cm⁻¹ and ~1450 cm⁻¹). A sharp band near 1100 cm⁻¹ may indicate C–O stretching contributions from the imide structure.

Key features include: 1. **Alkene Region**: A prominent cross-peak at ~5.5 ppm (¹H) and ~125 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the vinylic proton and carbon of the C=C bond. This deshielding is consistent with the double bond’s electron-withdrawing nature. 2. **Ethoxy Group**: Peaks at ~4.1 ppm (¹H) and ~60 ppm (¹³C) arise from the CH₂ group adjacent to the ester oxygen (O-CH₂-CH₃). The terminal methyl (CH₃) of the ethoxy group appears at ~1.2 ppm (¹H) and ~14 ppm (¹³C), typical for aliphatic methyl groups. 3. **Ethyl Substituent**: The ethyl group attached to the double bond (C=C-CH₂-CH₃) shows correlations at ~1.5–1.7 ppm (¹H) and ~25 ppm (¹³C) for the CH₂, and ~0.9 ppm (¹H) and ~10 ppm (¹³C) for the CH₃.

The most prominent peak near 155 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the urea functional group, which is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent nitrogen atoms. Additional peaks between 120–140 ppm arise from the aromatic carbons of the two benzene rings. The substitution pattern on these rings—specifically the electron-donating amine group (-NH2) on one ring and the electron-withdrawing chlorine (-Cl) and trifluoromethyl (-CF3) groups on the other—creates distinct chemical environments, leading to multiple resolved signals. The splitting of peaks in the aromatic region reflects the non-equivalence of carbon atoms due to these substituents. For instance, the carbons ortho and para to the -CF3 group experience significant deshielding, shifting their signals downfield (closer to 140 ppm), while the amine-substituted ring exhibits peaks at slightly lower shifts (120–130 ppm) due to increased electron density. The absence of signals below 100 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic or sp³-hybridized carbons in the molecule.

The spectrum displays several key peaks that align with the molecular structure and fragmentation patterns typical of this compound. The molecular ion peak (M⁺) appears at m/z 239, confirming the molecular weight of the intact molecule. A prominent peak at m/z 153, representing the base peak (100% relative abundance), corresponds to the benzimidazole ring system retaining the chlorine substituent, likely formed via cleavage of the ester side chain. This fragment is consistent with the loss of the ethoxycarbonylmethyl group (C₃H₅O₂, 73 Da) from the molecular ion. Additional significant peaks include m/z 211, which suggests the loss of ethylene (C₂H₄, 28 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for esters. The peak at m/z 193 arises from further decomposition, potentially involving the loss of carbon dioxide (CO₂, 44 Da) from the m/z 239 ion. Peaks at m/z 165 and 166 may correspond to rearrangement ions or smaller aromatic fragments retaining portions of the benzimidazole core. The presence of chlorine is corroborated by the isotope pattern observed in peaks such as m/z 153 (chlorine’s natural isotopic abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl produces a characteristic 3:1 ratio in fragment ions containing Cl). Minor peaks at m/z 106, 118, and 119 likely represent smaller heterocyclic or aromatic fragments, such as the benzimidazole ring without substituents or with partial degradation. The low-abundance peak at m/z 152 may indicate a fragment where the chlorine is replaced by a hydrogen, though this is less common. Overall, the fragmentation pattern reflects the stability of the benzimidazole ring system and the susceptibility of the ester linkage to cleavage under electron ionization. These spectral features provide strong evidence for the assigned molecular structure."

The spectrum displays correlations between 1H and 13C nuclei, revealing key structural features. The 1H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans ~14 to -2 ppm, while the 13C axis (y-axis) ranges from ~200 to 0 ppm. Distinct cross-peaks correspond to directly bonded 1H-13C pairs. In the aromatic region (1H: 6.5–8.5 ppm; 13C: 120–150 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, consistent with the two fluorinated phenyl rings and heteroaromatic systems in the molecule. The deshielded 1H shifts (~7.5–8.5 ppm) likely arise from protons on the fluorinated phenyl rings, where electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms induce downfield shifts. Corresponding 13C shifts (~130–145 ppm) align with aromatic carbons adjacent to fluorine or nitrogen.

A distinct cross-peak at ~1H 5.0 ppm and 13C 55 ppm suggests a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an electronegative atom, likely the piperazine ring’s N-CH2-CH2-N moiety. Additional aliphatic CH2 correlations appear at ~1H 3.0–4.0 ppm and 13C 40–50 ppm, further supporting the piperazine structure. The absence of peaks in the 13C 160–180 ppm range indicates no directly observable carbonyl carbons in this HSQC experiment, as the amide carbonyl (O=C) lacks attached protons. The spectrum’s sparsity in the 1H 0–2 ppm region confirms the lack of aliphatic methyl groups, consistent with the molecular formula. Fluorine’s influence is evident in the deshielded aromatic signals, while the triazine and imidazole rings contribute to the complex splitting patterns in the 1H 7–9 ppm range. Overall, the HSQC data aligns with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic CH2 environments in the molecule."

The region below 1500 cm⁻¹ displays complex fingerprint patterns, including C-F stretching vibrations (~1100–1300 cm⁻¹) from the difluorophenyl group (c3cc(F)ccc3F) and C-O stretching from the hydroxyl groups (~1050–1150 cm⁻¹). Aromatic C-H out-of-plane bending modes from the fluorinated phenyl ring and heterocyclic aromatic systems (e.g., pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine core) appear as weaker bands near 700–900 cm⁻¹. The absence of strong absorptions near 2200 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of nitrile or alkyne groups. Overall, the spectral features align with the structural motifs of the molecule, including amide, hydroxyl, fluorinated aromatic, and heterocyclic components."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H11BrO2 (SMILES: BrC/C=C/c1ccc2c(c1)OCCO2). The spectrum displays a molecular ion peak at m/z 255, corresponding to the intact molecule, with a prominent isotope peak at m/z 256 due to the natural abundance of bromine-81 (Br-79 and Br-81 isotopes in a ~1:1 ratio). The base peak at m/z 132 indicates a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the allylic C–C bond adjacent to the aromatic ring, generating a resonance-stabilized cationic fragment. Additional key peaks include m/z 162, 118, 104, 89, and 79, which suggest sequential fragmentation pathways. The peak at m/z 162 may result from the loss of a bromine atom (Br•) and a small neutral fragment (e.g., C2H2), while m/z 118 could correspond to the benzodioxole ring system (C7H6O2) after cleavage of the propenyl chain. The peak at m/z 89 suggests further fragmentation of the dioxane ring, possibly forming a C4H5O2+ fragment. The m/z 79 peak aligns with the bromine atom itself (Br+), consistent with homolytic cleavage of the C–Br bond. Smaller peaks at m/z 175 and 176 may arise from the loss of HBr (255 – 80 = 175) or related rearrangements. The presence of bromine is further supported by the characteristic isotope pattern observed in peaks containing the halogen. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern reflects the molecule’s structural features, including the allylic bromine substituent and the electron-rich benzodioxole moiety, which stabilizes carbocation intermediates during ionization. These observations align with the proposed molecular structure and provide insights into its gas-phase dissociation behavior."

The spectrum displays four distinct cross-peaks, each corresponding to directly bonded ^1H-^13C pairs. The most downfield proton signal at ~12 ppm correlates with a carbon at ~150 ppm, indicative of an aromatic or conjugated system. This feature likely arises from the oxime-substituted aromatic carbon (C=N-OH), where the deshielded proton environment reflects strong electron withdrawal from the adjacent nitrogen and oxygen. A second aromatic proton at ~10 ppm couples to a carbon at ~120 ppm, consistent with a proton on the benzene ring meta to the electron-withdrawing oxime group. The peak at ~6 ppm (proton) and ~60 ppm (carbon) corresponds to the methylene group (-CH2-) in the NCC(F)(F)F side chain, where the carbon’s moderate downfield shift reflects its proximity to the electronegative trifluoromethyl group. Finally, the upfield cross-peak at ~4 ppm (proton) and ~30 ppm (carbon) matches the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the aromatic ring, with its chemical shifts typical of an aliphatic methyl substituent. The absence of additional peaks aligns with the molecule’s quaternary carbons (e.g., carbonyl, oxime carbon, and CF3 group), which lack directly bonded protons. This HSQC data effectively maps the protonated carbons and their respective environments, confirming the structural features of the molecule."

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands that align with the structural features of the molecule. In the region between 3500–3100 cm⁻¹, a moderate to strong absorption band is observed near 3300 cm⁻¹, consistent with the N–H stretching vibration of the secondary amine group (NH) present in the structure. This peak is slightly broadened, suggesting potential hydrogen bonding interactions. Adjacent to this, sharp peaks in the 3100–3000 cm⁻¹ range correspond to aromatic C–H stretching vibrations from the benzene ring, while weaker absorptions below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aliphatic C–H stretches from the CH₂ group. A prominent peak near 1600 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the C=C stretching vibrations of the aromatic ring, with additional weaker bands in the 1500–1450 cm⁻¹ region further supporting the presence of an aromatic system. The strong absorption around 1200 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the C–F stretching vibration, confirming the fluorine substitution on the benzene ring. This is consistent with the molecular formula and the SMILES notation, which places fluorine directly on the aromatic ring. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), multiple sharp peaks are observed, including a notable band near 750 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of out-of-plane C–H bending vibrations typical of a monosubstituted benzene ring. Additional peaks in the 1100–1000 cm⁻¹ range may arise from C–N stretching or coupled vibrations involving the amine group. The absence of significant absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of carbonyl (C=O) functionality, aligning with the provided structure.

The most prominent peak, located at approximately 6 ppm, corresponds to the two vinyl protons of the α,β-unsaturated ester group (/C=C/). These protons exhibit a trans-configuration coupling pattern, typically appearing as a doublet with a large coupling constant (~15–16 Hz), though the splitting may not be fully resolved in this spectrum. The high intensity of this peak reflects the deshielded nature of these protons due to conjugation with the carbonyl group. Adjacent to this, a smaller peak near 7 ppm integrates to four aromatic protons, consistent with the para-substituted benzene ring in the structure. The symmetry of the ring divides these protons into two equivalent pairs, appearing as two doublets (each integrating to 2H) due to coupling with neighboring protons. The electron-donating effect of the -OCH2CH2OH substituent slightly shields these protons, shifting them upfield compared to unsubstituted aromatic systems. A distinct peak at ~4 ppm corresponds to the two methylene protons (-OCH2-) directly attached to the benzene ring. This signal is deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom. Another peak at ~3.7 ppm represents the methylene protons (-CH2OH) of the ethylene glycol side chain, which are further deshielded by the hydroxyl group. The methyl ester (-COOCH3) produces a singlet near 3.8 ppm, integrating to three protons. Finally, a broad peak around 2 ppm is attributed to the hydroxyl proton (-OH), which may exchange with residual water or appear as a singlet depending on solvent conditions. The absence of peaks below 2 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic or alkyl groups beyond the described functionalities. The spectrum collectively supports the assigned structure, with all proton environments accounted for and consistent with the molecular formula and SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays several distinct features characteristic of the molecular structure. The most prominent peak appears at approximately 6.0 ppm as a singlet, which likely corresponds to the methoxy group (-OCH3) of the methyl ester moiety. This shift is slightly downfield compared to typical aliphatic ester protons (usually ~3.5–4.0 ppm), suggesting deshielding due to the adjacent aromatic system or hydrogen-bonding interactions. Additional peaks are observed in the aromatic region (7.0–8.5 ppm), though they are less intense. These correspond to the protons on the two aromatic rings: the para-substituted benzene ring (attached to the ester and ketone groups) and the fused benzene ring of the quinazolinone core. The splitting pattern and integration would typically reveal the symmetry of the para-substituted ring (expected as two doublets) and the multiplicity of the quinazolinone’s aromatic protons. However, the spectrum’s resolution or overlapping signals may obscure fine splitting. A sharp singlet near 12.0 ppm is attributed to the NH proton of the quinazolinone ring, which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl and nitrogen atoms. Smaller peaks at ~10.5 and ~11.0 ppm may arise from exchangeable protons or minor tautomeric forms, though the primary NH resonance dominates this region. The absence of peaks in the aliphatic region (<3.0 ppm) confirms no additional alkyl groups are present beyond the methoxy substituent. The overall spectral features align with the expected electronic environments of the molecule: deshielded aromatic protons, a downfield-shifted methoxy group, and a strongly deshielded NH proton. This analysis supports the structural assignment of the compound as a methyl ester-linked quinazolinone derivative."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates ^1H and ^13C chemical shifts for directly bonded proton-carbon pairs, providing insights into the molecule's structural features. The spectrum displays three distinct cross-peaks, indicating three unique protonated carbon environments. The most downfield ^1H chemical shift (~12.5 ppm) is observed for a proton attached to a carbon resonating at ~170 ppm in the ^13C dimension. This extreme downfield ^1H shift suggests a highly deshielded proton, likely an aromatic NH or a carboxylic acid proton involved in strong hydrogen bonding or conjugation. However, the corresponding ^13C shift at 170 ppm is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (e.g., from a carboxylic acid or amide group). The presence of a proton correlation here is unusual, as carbonyl carbons typically lack directly attached protons. This anomaly may arise from spectral artifacts, tautomeric equilibria, or misassignment. Two additional cross-peaks are observed at ^1H shifts of ~11.0 ppm and ~10.5 ppm, correlating with ^13C shifts of ~120 ppm and ~115 ppm, respectively. These values are consistent with aromatic protons attached to sp²-hybridized carbons in an electron-deficient environment. The high ^1H shifts indicate strong deshielding, likely due to the proximity of electron-withdrawing groups such as nitriles (-C#N) and trifluoromethyl (-CF₃) substituents on the aromatic rings. The ^13C shifts at 120–115 ppm further support aromatic carbons, possibly adjacent to nitrile or carboxylic acid groups, which withdraw electron density via resonance and inductive effects. The absence of additional cross-peaks suggests limited protonated carbon diversity, consistent with the molecule’s symmetric features. The two carboxylic acid groups (-C(=O)O) and two nitriles (-C#N) create a highly conjugated, electron-deficient aromatic system, explaining the pronounced deshielding of protons and carbons. The trifluoromethyl group (-CF₃) further contributes to the electronic complexity through strong inductive effects. In summary, the HSQC spectrum highlights three key protonated carbon environments in a conjugated aromatic framework, with extreme chemical shifts reflecting the influence of multiple electron-withdrawing substituents. The data align with the proposed structure, though the carbonyl carbon correlation warrants further investigation to resolve potential ambiguities."

Finally, the aliphatic region shows a peak at ~20–30 ppm, corresponding to the two N-methyl groups (one on the maleimide nitrogen and one on the indole nitrogen), which appear as a single resonance due to their similar electronic environments. The spectrum confirms the structural features of the molecule, including the brominated maleimide core and the substituted indole group, with chemical shifts consistent with the expected electronic effects of functional groups and heteroatoms."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups present in this carbamate-protected amino acid derivative. A broad, intense peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a secondary amide N-H stretch, consistent with the carbamate (Boc) group. Sharp, strong absorptions around 2950 cm⁻¹ correspond to C-H stretching vibrations of aliphatic methyl and methylene groups, including contributions from the tert-butyl moiety. The most prominent feature is the intense carbonyl stretching region near 1735 cm⁻¹, attributed to the ester C=O bond of the benzyl-protected carboxylic acid, while a slightly weaker band near 1650 cm⁻¹ arises from the amide C=O stretch of the carbamate. Aromatic C-H stretching vibrations appear as weaker peaks near 3050 cm⁻¹, confirming the presence of the benzyl group. Additional bands in the 1500–1300 cm⁻¹ range correspond to C-N stretching and N-H bending vibrations of the carbamate, as well as C=C stretching modes of the aromatic ring. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex patterns from C-O stretching of the ester and carbamate groups (1250–1100 cm⁻¹) and aromatic C-H in-plane bending (1000–600 cm⁻¹). Notably, the absence of a broad absorption near 2500–3300 cm⁻¹ confirms the carboxylic acid is fully protected as an ester. This spectral profile aligns with the structural features of the Boc-protected phenylalanine derivative, providing evidence for the integrity of its functional groups and overall molecular framework."

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to functional groups in the molecule. A broad, moderate-intensity band near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of N–H stretching vibrations, likely from the hydrazone (–NH–N=C–) and sulfonamide (–SO₂NH–) groups. A sharp, intense peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the C=O stretching vibration of the amide carbonyl group (–CONH–). Multiple overlapping peaks in the 1600–1500 cm⁻¹ region arise from C=C stretching in the aromatic benzene and furan rings, as well as contributions from the C=N stretching vibration of the hydrazone moiety. The strong absorption bands between 1350–1150 cm⁻¹ are indicative of the sulfone group (–SO₂–), with asymmetric and symmetric S=O stretching vibrations typically observed in this range. The sharp, intense peak near 700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to out-of-plane C–H bending vibrations of the monosubstituted benzene ring, confirming its presence. Additional weaker peaks in the fingerprint region (below 1000 cm⁻¹) may arise from C–O stretching in the furan ring and other skeletal vibrations. The absence of significant absorption above 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests minimal O–H or free N–H stretching, consistent with the molecular structure.

The spectrum exhibits several key features characteristic of its functional groups and molecular structure. In the region between 3000–3100 cm⁻¹, sharp peaks correspond to aromatic C-H stretching vibrations, consistent with the presence of multiple benzene rings in the quinoline and phenyl substituents. A series of weaker absorptions near 2850–2950 cm⁻¹ are attributed to aliphatic C-H stretching in the ethyl linker (CC) and methylene group (CH₂) of the benzyl ether moiety. The most intense peak near 1600 cm⁻¹ arises from C=C stretching vibrations in the aromatic rings, particularly the conjugated system of the quinoline core. Additional aromatic C=C stretches are observed at ~1500 cm⁻¹ and ~1450 cm⁻¹, reflecting the substituted benzene rings. A prominent band near 1200 cm⁻¹ is indicative of C-F stretching vibrations, consistent with the two fluorine atoms attached to the quinoline ring. This region is further supported by weaker absorptions between 1000–1100 cm⁻¹, which may correspond to C-O stretching in the ether linkage (OCH₂Ph). In the fingerprint region (below 1000 cm⁻¹), a sharp peak at ~800 cm⁻¹ is assignable to out-of-plane C-H bending vibrations of the aromatic rings, suggesting substitution patterns typical of para-disubstituted benzene (e.g., the ethylphenyl and benzyl ether groups). The absence of broad absorptions near 3300 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of O-H or N-H functional groups, aligning with the molecular structure. Overall, the spectral features corroborate the presence of aromatic systems, fluorine substituents, and ether functionalities in the compound."

A prominent peak near 1650 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the cyclic amide (lactam) moiety, consistent with the gamma-lactam structure in the SMILES notation. Two strong, sharp absorptions at approximately 1320 cm⁻¹ and 1150 cm⁻¹ correspond to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the sulfonyl (S(=O)(=O)) group, respectively, which are hallmark features of sulfonamide derivatives. In the region between 2850–2960 cm⁻¹, multiple peaks are observed, likely arising from aliphatic C–H stretching vibrations in the isopropyl (CC(C)S–) and cycloalkyl (CCC) segments of the molecule.

In the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm), several peaks are observed, including a prominent signal near 50 ppm, likely corresponding to the morpholine ring’s methylene carbons (CH2) adjacent to the oxygen atom. Additional peaks at ~20–30 ppm are consistent with the isopropyl group’s methyl (CH3) and methine (CH) carbons, while a signal near 40 ppm may arise from the methylene group (CH2) linking the morpholine nitrogen to the aromatic ring. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple resonances reflect the molecule’s conjugated systems. A cluster of peaks between 120–140 ppm corresponds to the triazole ring (n1cc...nn1) and pyridine ring (cnc2N) carbons, with the triazole’s carbon adjacent to nitrogen typically appearing near 120–130 ppm. The pyridine ring exhibits deshielded carbons due to the electron-withdrawing amino group (NH2) and substituents, with shifts around 140–150 ppm for quaternary carbons. A distinct peak near 150 ppm likely represents the pyridine carbon directly bonded to the NH2 group. The aromatic region also includes signals from the two substituted phenyl rings. The peak near 130 ppm may correspond to the carbon meta to the chlorine substituent on the phenyl ring, while the carbon adjacent to chlorine (electron-withdrawing) is expected to resonate downfield (~130–140 ppm). The absence of signals above 160 ppm confirms no carbonyl or highly deshielded sp2 carbons beyond those in aromatic systems. The spectrum’s peak intensities correlate with the number of equivalent carbons: for example, the isopropyl methyl groups (two equivalent CH3) and morpholine CH2 carbons (two equivalent CH2) contribute to higher-intensity signals. Overall, the C-NMR data aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the molecule’s diverse carbon environments, including aliphatic, heteroaromatic (triazole, pyridine), and substituted aromatic systems."

The base peak at m/z 172 indicates a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the ester group and loss of the methoxy-carbonyl moiety (COOCH3, 76 Da), leaving a charged indole-amine fragment. Additional significant peaks at m/z 130, 146, and 158 suggest sequential fragmentation of the indole ring system, with m/z 130 corresponding to the indole core (C8H6N) after loss of the side chain. Peaks at m/z 173 and 174 exhibit a characteristic 1:1 ratio, indicative of a chlorine isotope pattern, though no chlorine is present in the formula—this may instead reflect overlapping isotopic contributions from carbon-13 or nitrogen-15 in the indole structure. The peak at m/z 189 likely represents a fragment retaining the methoxy-substituted indole with partial side-chain cleavage. Higher-mass fragments at m/z 232 and 214 suggest neutral losses of 16 Da (possibly NH3 or CH4) and 34 Da (potentially H2S or NH2OH), though these assignments require further validation. The absence of peaks above m/z 250 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity, while the distribution of lower-mass fragments aligns with expected degradation pathways for tryptophan-derived esters. This spectrum exemplifies typical fragmentation behavior for indole alkaloids, with dominant cleavage at the ester and amine functionalities, enabling structural elucidation through mass transitions."

The most downfield peak at 12.5 ppm (singlet) likely corresponds to the amine proton (-NH2) attached to the benzofuran ring system, which is deshielded due to resonance with the adjacent electron-withdrawing ketone group (C=O) and conjugation within the aromatic system.

The peak at 8.2 ppm (singlet) is consistent with an aromatic proton ortho to the ketone substituent on the benzofuran, which experiences strong electron-withdrawing effects. Two additional singlets at 6.5 ppm and 6.2 ppm correspond to protons on the methoxy-substituted benzene ring (c1cc...cc(OC)c1OC), where the methoxy groups (-OCH3) donate electron density via resonance, shielding these protons relative to those near the ketone. The absence of peaks below 6 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic protons in the structure, consistent with the fully aromatic framework and methoxy substituents.

Aromatic protons appear as a multiplet between 7.5–8.5 ppm, reflecting the substituted benzene and pyridazine rings. The benzene ring protons, particularly those ortho to the CF3 group, exhibit downfield shifts due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of CF3, while the pyridazine ring protons contribute to the complexity of this region. A singlet at ~2.5 ppm is assigned to the methyl group (CH3) on the benzene ring, which is slightly deshielded by the adjacent CF3 substituent. Additional peaks between 3.0–3.5 ppm likely correspond to the piperazine ring protons (CH2), which are split due to their diastereotopic environments and coupling with neighboring protons. The absence of signals below 2 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic protons outside the piperazine and methyl groups. The spectrum’s intensity distribution aligns with the 16 protons in the molecule, with the highest peak at 4.0 ppm reflecting the combined contribution of the amide-adjacent CH2 and potential overlap with solvent or impurity signals. The CF3 groups themselves do not produce direct signals in H-NMR but influence the chemical shifts of nearby protons through inductive effects. This spectral pattern is consistent with the proposed structure, validating the presence of aromatic, amide, and piperazine functionalities."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon environments corresponding to the structural features of the molecule. The most downfield peak, observed near 170 ppm, is characteristic of the carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the ester functional group, which typically resonates in the 165–180 ppm range due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the oxygen atom. Adjacent to this, a peak around 60–70 ppm likely corresponds to the methylene carbon (CH2) directly bonded to the ester oxygen, as such carbons are deshielded by the electronegative oxygen and typically appear in this region. The spectrum also exhibits multiple peaks between 120–140 ppm, which are indicative of sp²-hybridized carbons in the conjugated diene system (C=CC=CC). These shifts are consistent with the alternating double bonds in the aliphatic chain, where the chemical environment of each alkene carbon is influenced by resonance and neighboring substituents. The presence of two distinct peaks in this region suggests non-equivalent alkene carbons, likely due to the geometry or substitution pattern of the double bonds. In the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm), several peaks are observed, corresponding to the saturated carbons in the long hydrocarbon chain. The most intense peak near 30 ppm likely represents the majority of the CH2 groups in the chain, which exhibit similar chemical shifts due to their repetitive, non-branching structure.

Additionally, the peak near 14 ppm is consistent with the methyl group adjacent to the ester oxygen (CH3COO–), which is slightly deshielded compared to terminal methyl groups. The integration of peak intensities aligns with the molecular symmetry, as the ester group and conjugated diene create distinct carbon environments. The absence of peaks above 200 ppm confirms the lack of ketone or aldehyde functionalities, while the lack of aromatic signals (100–160 ppm) indicates no aromatic rings are present. Overall, the spectrum reflects the structural motifs of a long-chain ester with a conjugated diene system, consistent with the provided molecular formula and SMILES notation."

The most downfield peak, near 170 ppm, corresponds to the amide carbonyl carbon (C=O), which is highly deshielded due to the electronegativity of the oxygen and resonance effects. Two prominent peaks around 150–160 ppm are attributed to the quaternary aromatic carbons directly bonded to oxygen atoms: one in the phenoxy ring (Oc2ccccc2) and the other in the para-substituted phenyl ring attached to the chiral center.

The peak at m/z 122 suggests cleavage of the heterocyclic ring system, potentially retaining a substituted pyridine or pyridazine fragment. Peaks at m/z 107–109 and 91–93 likely result from further decomposition of the aromatic framework, with the latter group possibly indicating smaller nitrogen-containing fragments or tropylium-like ions stabilized by resonance. Notably, the absence of significant peaks below m/z 90 implies that the molecule’s structural integrity is maintained in larger fragments, reflecting the robustness of the fused-ring system. The isotopic pattern at m/z 91 and 93 (with a ~3:1 ratio) may hint at the presence of a chlorine-like isotope distribution, though this is inconsistent with the molecular formula and likely arises from overlapping fragment contributions. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, emphasizing the stability of the protonated molecular ion and systematic fragmentation pathways characteristic of nitrogen-rich heterocycles."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C31H30O3 (SMILES: OCC/C(=C(/c1ccccc1)c1ccc(OCCOCc2ccccc2)cc1)c1ccccc1). The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, reflecting the molecule's complex structure. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), multiple sharp peaks are observed, corresponding to the 19 aromatic protons distributed across three benzene rings. The para-substituted ring in the central aromatic group (c1ccc(OCCOCc2ccccc2)cc1) likely contributes to the symmetric splitting patterns, while the monosubstituted rings (c1ccccc1) produce overlapping multiplets. A prominent singlet near 10 ppm is attributed to the hydroxyl proton (OCC–OH), which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding. In the aliphatic region (1–5 ppm), peaks at ~4.5–5 ppm arise from the methylene protons (CH2) adjacent to oxygen atoms in the ethoxy (OCH2CH2O) and benzyl ether (OCH2c6h5) groups. The CH2 groups in the OCC chain and ethoxy linker appear as multiplets at ~3.5–4 ppm, while the central CH2 in the ethoxy chain (CH2OCH2) resonates slightly upfield (~3–3.5 ppm). The integration ratios align with the molecular formula, confirming the presence of 30 protons. The absence of signals in the 5–6 ppm range indicates no vinylic protons, consistent with the fully substituted double bond in the structure. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the molecule's aromaticity, oxygenated aliphatic chains, and hydroxyl functionality."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, consistent with the structural features of the compound. Key observations include: 1. **Carbonyl Region (160–180 ppm):** A prominent peak near 170 ppm corresponds to the ester carbonyl carbon (COOCH₃) in the side chain. This shift is characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons in esters, deshielded by the electronegative oxygen atom. 2. **Aromatic Region (110–150 ppm):** Multiple peaks between 120–140 ppm arise from the two aromatic rings in the molecule. The benzene ring attached to the sulfonamide group (NSO₂) shows signals near 130–140 ppm, with bromine substitution causing downfield shifts due to its electron-withdrawing inductive effect. The second aromatic ring (linked to the amide group) contributes peaks in the 120–130 ppm range, with slight upfield shifts compared to the brominated ring. 3. **Aliphatic Region (10–60 ppm):** - A triplet near 60 ppm is attributed to the methylene carbon (CH₂) adjacent to the ester oxygen (OCH₂CH₂COOCH₃), deshielded by the oxygen atom. - Peaks between 40–50 ppm correspond to the methine carbon (CH) bonded to the sulfonamide nitrogen and the methylene groups in the butyl chain. - The terminal methyl group (CH₃) of the butyl chain appears as a triplet near 10–15 ppm, typical for aliphatic methyl groups. 4. **Sulfonamide-Linked Carbon:** A distinct peak near 50 ppm is consistent with the carbon directly bonded to the sulfonamide nitrogen (N–CH), which is deshielded by the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group (SO₂). The spectrum lacks signals above 180 ppm, confirming the absence of aldehyde or ketone carbonyl groups. The integration of peak intensities aligns with the molecular formula, with the aromatic region showing six distinct signals (two rings, each with three unique carbons due to substitution patterns) and the aliphatic region reflecting the five-carbon butyl chain and side-chain carbons. The bromine atom’s presence is indirectly supported by the downfield shifts of adjacent aromatic carbons. Overall, the spectral features are consistent with the proposed structure, validating the molecular formula and connectivity."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C15H13N3O (SMILES: COc1cccc(N=Cc2cc3ccccn3n2)c1). The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak appears near 170 ppm, which is characteristic of a deshielded aromatic carbon, likely the imine carbon (C=N) in the structure. This high chemical shift arises from the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent nitrogen atom. A sharp peak at ~150 ppm corresponds to the aromatic carbons bonded to electronegative substituents, such as the carbon adjacent to the methoxy group (-OCH3) on the benzene ring or the pyridine ring nitrogen. Multiple peaks between 100–130 ppm represent the aromatic carbons in the benzene and pyridine rings. These shifts are consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons in conjugated systems, with variations due to substituent effects. For example, the carbon directly bonded to the imine group in the benzene ring may appear in this region due to resonance deshielding. A distinct peak at ~50 ppm is attributed to the methoxy group’s methyl carbon (-OCH3), which typically resonates in this range due to the shielding effect of the oxygen atom. Notably, a minor peak near 30 ppm suggests the presence of an aliphatic carbon, though the molecule lacks explicit aliphatic chains. This could indicate a minor impurity, solvent signal, or an artifact from the NMR measurement. The absence of signals below 0 ppm or above 200 ppm confirms no highly shielded or exceptionally deshielded carbons (e.g., carbonyl groups) are present. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, showcasing key features of aromaticity, nitrogen-containing heterocycles, and methoxy substitution. The limited number of peaks relative to the 15 carbons suggests potential symmetry or overlapping signals in the aromatic regions, which is common in conjugated systems."

The spectrum displays a molecular ion peak at m/z 244, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 243 g/mol for C14H13NO3. The base peak at m/z 130 dominates the spectrum, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. This fragment likely arises from cleavage of the ether linkage (C-O) between the alkyne-containing chain and the phthalimide group, generating a phthalimide-derived ion (C8H4NO2⁺, calculated m/z 130). Additional prominent peaks at m/z 147 and 148 suggest further fragmentation of the phthalimide ring, possibly via loss of CO or rearrangement pathways. Peaks at m/z 77, 81, and 98 correspond to common aromatic and aliphatic fragments, such as benzene derivatives (C6H5⁺, m/z 77) and alkyl fragments from the hexynyl chain (C5H9⁺, m/z 69; C6H9⁺, m/z 81). The presence of the alkyne group is supported by minor peaks in the low-m/z region (e.g., m/z 53, 55), which may represent propargyl or allylic fragments. The peak at m/z 190 could result from partial loss of the phthalimide group, retaining part of the aromatic system. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the phthalimide core, ether linkage, and terminal alkyne. The spectrum provides clear evidence for the molecular integrity and characteristic breakdown pathways of this compound under mass spectrometric conditions."

A sharp, intense peak at ~2200 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the nitrile (C≡N) stretch, consistent with the C#N group in the SMILES notation. Broad absorption near 3300 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an N-H stretch from the secondary amine (NH group linked to the aromatic ring). A strong, sharp band at ~1730 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of the ethyl ester moiety (CCOC=O), while weaker peaks in the 2800–3000 cm⁻¹ range arise from C-H stretches of aromatic and aliphatic hydrogens. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays multiple peaks, including C-O stretches (~1200–1300 cm⁻¹) from the ether linkage (Oc4ccccc4) and aromatic C=C vibrations (1400–1600 cm⁻¹).

The most downfield peak at approximately 175 ppm corresponds to the thioester carbonyl carbon (C=S), which is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent sulfur and oxygen atoms. A peak at 55 ppm is assigned to the methoxy group (OCH3), where the carbon is shielded by the oxygen atom but slightly deshielded by the adjacent thioester group. The peak at 50 ppm corresponds to the methylene carbon (CH2) of the ethyl group attached to the sulfonyl moiety (SO2), as sulfonyl groups strongly deshield adjacent carbons. A peak at 25 ppm is attributed to the methyl group (S-CH3) bonded to the sulfur atom in the sulfonamide-thiourea-like linkage, reflecting moderate shielding from the sulfur. Finally, the most intense peak at 0 ppm arises from the terminal methyl group (CH3) of the ethyl chain, which is highly shielded due to its aliphatic nature and distance from electronegative substituents. The absence of peaks in the aromatic (100–150 ppm) or olefinic (100–120 ppm) regions confirms the lack of sp2-hybridized carbons beyond the thioester functionality.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates proton (1H) and carbon (13C) chemical shifts for directly bonded pairs, providing insights into the molecular structure. The spectrum displays three distinct regions of interest. First, a cluster of peaks appears in the aromatic region, with 1H chemical shifts between 6.5–8.5 ppm and 13C shifts spanning 100–150 ppm. These correspond to the protons and carbons of the benzimidazole ring (substituted with chlorine) and the two phenyl rings connected via an ether linkage. The chlorine substituent on the benzimidazole ring induces deshielding, shifting adjacent protons and carbons downfield. The electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group (S(=O)2) on the isopropyl chain also contributes to the deshielding of nearby aromatic protons. A second group of peaks is observed at 1H shifts of 2–4 ppm and 13C shifts of 50–60 ppm. These correlations likely arise from the methine proton (CH) of the isopropyl group attached to the sulfonyl moiety. The sulfonyl group’s strong electron-withdrawing effect deshields the methine carbon, shifting its 13C resonance downfield compared to typical aliphatic carbons. The corresponding proton signal appears in the expected range for a CH group adjacent to an electronegative sulfur atom. Finally, two isolated peaks are visible at 1H ~0 ppm and 13C ~−2 ppm. These are attributed to the methyl groups (CH3) of the isopropyl chain. The upfield shift of the 13C signal suggests a shielding effect, likely due to the spatial orientation of the methyl groups relative to the sulfonyl group. The 1H shifts near 0 ppm are unusually upfield but may result from magnetic anisotropy effects in the molecular environment or partial overlap with residual solvent signals (e.g., deuterated chloroform at ~7.26 ppm, though not directly visible here). The spectrum confirms the presence of all expected protonated carbons in the molecule, including aromatic, methine, and methyl environments. The distribution of peaks aligns with the structural features of the benzimidazole core, chlorinated aromatic ring, ether-linked phenyl group, and sulfonamide-bound isopropyl chain. No quaternary carbons (e.g., the benzimidazole nitrogen-attached carbons or the sulfonamide sulfur) are detected in HSQC, as they lack directly bonded protons. This analysis underscores the utility of HSQC in mapping proton-carbon connectivity in complex heterocyclic systems."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak appears near 175 ppm, corresponding to the carbonyl carbon of the acetyl group (COCH3) attached to the aniline nitrogen. This high-field shift is characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons in amide or ester functionalities. Adjacent to this, a smaller peak at ~165 ppm likely arises from the benzamide carbonyl group (C(=O)NH2), which is slightly deshielded due to resonance with the aromatic ring. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the complex substitution pattern of the two phenyl rings and the pyrazole heterocycle. The peaks at ~150–160 ppm correspond to carbons directly bonded to electronegative nitrogen atoms in the pyrazole ring (C3 and C5 positions) and the aniline-linked phenyl ring. The cluster of peaks between 120–140 ppm represents the remaining aromatic carbons, including those in the benzamide-substituted phenyl ring and the pyrazole C4 position. The splitting into multiple signals indicates limited symmetry in the aromatic systems, consistent with the asymmetric substitution pattern in the SMILES notation. A moderate peak at ~50 ppm is attributed to the methylene carbons (CH2) in the piperidine ring, which are deshielded by the adjacent nitrogen atom. This region may also include contributions from the pyrazole-linked ethylene bridge. A smaller peak near 20 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (CH3) of the acetyl substituent, which appears upfield due to its sp³ hybridization and lack of conjugation. The spectrum’s overall complexity aligns with the molecular formula’s 21 unique carbons, though some peaks may overlap due to similar chemical environments. The absence of signals below 10 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic quaternary carbons or heavily shielded environments. This C-NMR data provides critical insights into the molecule’s structural motifs, including the acetylated aniline, benzamide, pyrazole, and piperidine components, each contributing distinct spectral signatures that validate the proposed structure."

The ¹H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans approximately -2 to 14 ppm, while the ¹³C axis (y-axis) ranges from 0 to 200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic region (¹H: 6.5–8.0 ppm; ¹³C: 100–160 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to the aromatic protons and their directly bonded carbons in the indole and phenyl rings. The indole ring (c1ccc2c(c1)c(C)c(C)n2) contributes peaks from its aromatic protons, while the substituted phenyl ring (c1ccc(OCC(=O)OC)cc1) exhibits correlations for its oxygenated aromatic carbons and protons. 2. **Aliphatic region (¹H: 1.0–3.5 ppm; ¹³C: 10–60 ppm):** Cross-peaks here arise from the methyl groups (c(C) and c(C) in the indole ring) and the methoxy group (OCH₃ in the ester side chain). The methyl groups appear as singlets in the ¹H dimension (~2.0–2.5 ppm) with corresponding ¹³C shifts (~15–25 ppm).

The adjacent carbon (C=CH₂) appears at ~135 ppm (¹³C), reflecting its sp² hybridization. 4. **Oxygenated aliphatic region (¹H: 3.5–5.0 ppm; ¹³C: 50–80 ppm):** Peaks in this range likely originate from the benzylic methylene (CH₂) linking the indole and phenyl rings (n2Cc1ccc...), with ¹H shifts ~4.0–4.5 ppm and ¹³C shifts ~60–70 ppm. Additional correlations may arise from the ethylene glycol-like segment (OCH₂COO) in the ester side chain. The absence of peaks in the carbonyl region (¹³C: 160–180 ppm) confirms that the ester carbonyl carbons (C=O) lack directly attached protons, as expected.

The most prominent peak at ~6 ppm (parts per million) corresponds to the deshielded protons of the aromatic ring adjacent to the ketone group (C=O), which induces electron withdrawal and shifts these protons downfield. A sharp, intense peak at ~10 ppm is attributed to the lactam NH proton in the five-membered ring system, a hallmark of secondary amide protons in hydrogen-bonded environments. Additional aromatic protons appear between 7–8 ppm, reflecting the complex splitting patterns of the two substituted benzene rings: one bearing an amino group (NH2) and the other fused to the lactam moiety. The NH2 group itself likely contributes to a broad signal near 5 ppm, though exchange broadening may obscure its exact position. Peaks in the 2–3 ppm range are consistent with the CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl in the lactam ring, though their low intensity suggests overlap with baseline noise or solvent signals. The absence of signals below 2 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic methyl or methylene groups outside the lactam structure. Integration of peak areas aligns with the molecular formula, accounting for 12 non-exchangeable protons (excluding labile NH/NH2 protons, which may not integrate reliably).

In the alkene region, three distinct cross-peaks are visible. Two peaks at approximately ¹H 5.5 ppm/¹³C 120 ppm and ¹H 5.3 ppm/¹³C 115 ppm correspond to the vinylic protons (CH₂=) and their attached sp²-hybridized carbons. A third peak at ¹H 8.0 ppm/¹³C 150 ppm represents the proton on the terminal sp² carbon (=CH–), which is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the double bond. These shifts are characteristic of a terminal alkene, consistent with the SMILES notation CC=CCCCCC (1-octene). In the aliphatic region, multiple peaks reflect the six methylene (–CH₂–) and one methyl (–CH₃) group in the chain. The methylene protons adjacent to the double bond (–CH₂–CH=) appear at slightly higher ¹H shifts (~2.0 ppm) due to the inductive effect of the alkene. Subsequent methylene groups exhibit progressively shielded ¹H shifts (1.2–1.5 ppm) as they move away from the double bond. The terminal methyl group (–CH₃) is observed near 0.9 ppm in ¹H and ~14 ppm in ¹³C, though its exact position may vary slightly depending on spectral resolution. The ¹³C shifts for the aliphatic carbons span 20–35 ppm, typical for sp³-hybridized carbons in a linear hydrocarbon chain. Notably, the absence of peaks in the aromatic (¹H 6.5–8.5 ppm, ¹³C 120–160 ppm) or carbonyl (¹³C 170–220 ppm) regions confirms the molecule lacks aromatic rings or carbonyl functionalities. The HSQC data aligns with the expected structure of 1-octene, where the terminal double bond dominates the spectral features, and the linear aliphatic chain contributes to the remaining correlations. This analysis underscores the utility of HSQC in mapping proton-carbon connectivity and validating structural assignments in unsaturated hydrocarbons."

A strong, sharp peak at approximately 1710 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the ester carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration, consistent with the OC(=O)c1cc2occc2[nH]1 moiety. This absorption is slightly shifted to lower wavenumbers compared to typical esters (1735–1750 cm⁻¹), likely due to conjugation with the adjacent aromatic system. A broad band near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the N-H stretching vibration of the pyrrole ring ([nH]1), a feature common in heterocyclic compounds with secondary amine groups. Additional peaks in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) provide further evidence of the molecular structure. A prominent band at ~1200 cm⁻¹ is indicative of C-O stretching in the ester linkage, while absorptions around 1500–1600 cm⁻¹ align with C=C stretching vibrations in the aromatic benzofuran (occc2) and pyrrole rings. The presence of multiple sharp peaks between 2850–2960 cm⁻¹ suggests C-H stretching from the isopropyl group (CC(C)O) and aromatic C-H bonds. Weak absorptions near 1000 cm⁻¹ may correspond to in-plane bending vibrations of the furan ring or ester C-O-C stretching. The overall spectral profile reflects a conjugated system with ester, heterocyclic, and aromatic functionalities, consistent with the assigned molecular formula and SMILES notation.

Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm in ¹H; 110–140 ppm in ¹³C):** A cluster of cross-peaks in this region corresponds to the two aromatic rings in the structure. The substituted benzene rings (one with OCF₂ and OCH₃ groups, the other part of the isoindolinone moiety) exhibit deshielded protons and carbons. The ¹³C shifts ~120–140 ppm align with sp²-hybridized carbons in aromatic systems, while the ¹H shifts ~7–8 ppm reflect protons ortho- to electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., OCF₂). 2. **Amide and Carbonyl Region (10–12 ppm in ¹H; ~150 ppm in ¹³C):** A distinct cross-peak near 10 ppm (¹H) and 150 ppm (¹³C) likely arises from the amide proton (NH) in the isoindolinone ring, though HSQC typically detects only ¹H-¹³C correlations. This suggests the peak may instead correspond to a deshielded aromatic carbon (e.g., quaternary carbon attached to electronegative substituents) with a directly bonded proton. The carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the isoindolinone is expected near 165–180 ppm but may appear slightly upfield due to conjugation. 3. **Aliphatic/Oxygenated Region (3–5 ppm in ¹H; 50–80 ppm in ¹³C):** Peaks in this range correlate with protons on carbons bonded to oxygen. The hydroxymethyl group (-CH₂OH) in the cyclopropane ring (OCC1(CO)COC1) likely contributes a cross-peak near ~3.5–4.5 ppm (¹H) and ~60–70 ppm (¹³C). The cyclopropane carbons, flanked by oxygen atoms, may exhibit shifts ~50–70 ppm due to strong deshielding. 4. **Methoxy Group (3.5–4 ppm in ¹H; ~55 ppm in ¹³C):** A cross-peak near 3.8 ppm (¹H) and 55 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methoxy (-OCH₃) substituent on the aromatic ring. The spectrum confirms the presence of aromatic, amide, and oxygenated aliphatic functionalities, consistent with the assigned structure. Fluorine substituents (OCF₂) induce deshielding in adjacent aromatic protons, shifting them downfield. The HSQC data, combined with the molecular formula and SMILES, validate the connectivity of key fragments, including the isoindolinone core, substituted aromatic rings, and cyclopropane-ether moiety."

    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C12H17O6P (SMILES: CCOP(=O)(OCC)C(=O)Oc1ccc(OC)cc1). The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups present in this organophosphate ester. A sharp, intense peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the ester group, consistent with the conjugation of the carbonyl to the aromatic ring, which slightly lowers the frequency compared to non-conjugated esters. A strong, broad band near ~1250 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the P=O stretching vibration of the phosphate moiety, a hallmark of organophosphorus compounds. Multiple overlapping peaks in the ~1100–1000 cm⁻¹ region arise from P-O-C stretching vibrations of the phosphate ester linkages, reflecting the asymmetric and symmetric stretches of the P-O bonds connected to the ethoxy and phenolic groups. In the 2800–3000 cm⁻¹ range, medium-intensity peaks are observed due to C-H stretching vibrations of the aliphatic ethoxy groups (OCH₂CH₃) and the methoxy substituent (OCH₃) on the aromatic ring. The aromatic C-H stretching vibrations appear as weaker absorptions near ~3050 cm⁻¹. A moderate band at ~1600 cm⁻¹ is assignable to the C=C stretching vibrations of the benzene ring, while a weaker feature near ~1500 cm⁻¹ may correspond to in-plane bending modes of the aromatic system. The fingerprint region below 1500 cm⁻¹ contains complex, overlapping peaks from bending vibrations of the phosphate ester, aromatic ring deformations, and C-O stretching of the methoxy group. These spectral features align with the structural motifs of the molecule: the phosphate ester (P=O, P-O-C), aromatic ester (C=O), and aliphatic/aryl ether (OCH₃, OCH₂CH₃) functionalities. The absence of broad O-H or N-H stretches confirms the lack of hydroxyl or amine groups, consistent with the molecular formula. This IR spectrum provides clear evidence for the presence of the key functional groups in C12H17O6P as defined by its SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across three regions: aliphatic, aromatic, and methylenedioxy. In the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm), three peaks are observed at approximately 20 ppm, 30 ppm, and 40 ppm. These correspond to the three carbons of the bromopropyl chain. The peak at ~40 ppm is assigned to the carbon directly bonded to bromine (CH2Br), which experiences deshielding due to the electronegative bromine atom. The middle carbon of the propyl chain (CH2) appears at ~30 ppm, while the terminal CH2 group adjacent to the aromatic ring is observed at ~20 ppm. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks are visible. The most downfield peak at ~150 ppm corresponds to the aromatic carbon bonded to the oxygen of the methylenedioxy group (OCH2O), as oxygen’s electronegativity deshields this carbon. Adjacent aromatic carbons, influenced by the electron-withdrawing methylenedioxy group, appear at ~140 ppm and ~130 ppm. A peak at ~120 ppm is attributed to the aromatic carbon directly attached to the propyl chain. The methylenedioxy group (OCH2O) produces a distinct peak at ~100 ppm, characteristic of the sp3-hybridized carbon in this cyclic acetal moiety. This carbon is shielded due to the electron-donating oxygen atoms, placing it upfield relative to aromatic carbons. The spectrum’s simplicity reflects the molecule’s symmetry and substitution pattern. The absence of additional peaks confirms the purity of the sample and the absence of significant impurities or conformational isomers. This C-NMR data aligns with the proposed structure, validating the molecular formula and connectivity provided by the SMILES notation."

The ester carbonyl typically appears at higher wavenumbers due to its electron-withdrawing nature, whereas the amide carbonyl is slightly lower due to resonance stabilization. A strong absorption around 2960 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching vibrations of the methyl (CH₃) groups in the isopropyl substituent and methoxy (OCH₃) groups. The aromatic C-H stretching vibrations appear as weaker peaks near 3030 cm⁻¹, consistent with the substituted benzene ring in the structure.

Key observations include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm, 100–150 ppm):** A cluster of cross-peaks in this region corresponds to protons and carbons in the aromatic systems, including the quinoline (c1ccc2c...), pyridine (ccnc2c1), and triazole-linked phenyl rings. The downfield ^1H shifts (~8–9 ppm) likely arise from protons adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitrogen atoms in the quinoline or triazole rings), while ^13C shifts in the 120–150 ppm range reflect sp²-hybridized carbons in these conjugated systems. 2. **Aliphatic Region (2–4 ppm, 20–60 ppm):** Peaks in this area correspond to the methoxy (OCH3) and dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) groups. The OCH3 group (from the methoxy substituent) exhibits a ^1H shift near ~3.8 ppm and a ^13C shift ~55 ppm, while the N(CH3)2 group shows ^1H shifts ~2.8–3.0 ppm and ^13C shifts ~40–45 ppm, consistent with methyl groups attached to nitrogen. 3. **Methylene Linker (4–5 ppm, 60–70 ppm):** A cross-peak near ~4.5 ppm (^1H) and ~65 ppm (^13C) likely corresponds to the CH2 group in the OCH2C linkage connecting the quinoline and triazole rings.

The spectrum displays two distinct cross-peaks, indicating correlations between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei. The first peak appears at approximately (¹H 12 ppm, ¹³C 120 ppm), while the second peak is observed at (¹H 4 ppm, ¹³C 10 ppm). The peak at ¹H 12 ppm and ¹³C 120 ppm corresponds to an aromatic proton and its attached carbon. This downfield proton chemical shift is characteristic of a hydrogen atom on a benzene ring strongly deshielded by adjacent electron-withdrawing groups. In this molecule, the aromatic ring (c2cc(C(=O)Cl)c(Cl)cc2F) contains three substituents: a carbonyl chloride (C(=O)Cl), a chlorine atom (Cl), and a fluorine atom (F). These groups create a highly electronegative environment, particularly for protons ortho to the C(=O)Cl and Cl substituents, explaining the extreme deshielding to 12 ppm. The correlated ¹³C shift at 120 ppm is consistent with an aromatic carbon bearing such substituents. The second peak at ¹H 4 ppm and ¹³C 10 ppm represents a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a carbon in a relatively shielded environment. The ¹³C shift of 10 ppm is typical for a methyl carbon bonded to an sp²-hybridized carbon, such as the methyl groups in the maleimide ring (CC1=C(C)C(=O)N...). The ¹H shift at 4 ppm is slightly downfield for a methyl group, likely due to its proximity to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups (C=O) in the maleimide ring, which deshield the methyl protons. Notably, the HSQC spectrum does not show correlations for all expected protons in the molecule (C13H8Cl2FNO3 contains 8 protons). This may be due to signal overlap, relaxation effects, or the exclusion of certain regions in the plotted spectrum. The observed peaks highlight key structural features: the substituted aromatic ring and the methyl-substituted maleimide core. HSQC analysis confirms the connectivity between the deshielded aromatic proton and its carbon, as well as the methyl group’s attachment to the maleimide ring, aiding in the assignment of this complex molecule’s structure."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 14 to -2 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of hydrogen atoms in the molecule. The most downfield peak at ~14 ppm is characteristic of a highly deshielded proton, likely originating from the NH group of the hydrazide-carbamate moiety (NNC(N)=O). This proton is strongly hydrogen-bonded, shifting its resonance significantly downfield. A second prominent peak at ~10 ppm may correspond to another NH proton from the same functional group, though its exact position suggests a slightly less deshielded environment, possibly due to differential hydrogen bonding or exchange effects. A sharp peak at ~8 ppm aligns with aromatic protons on the benzene ring substituted with a trifluoromethyl group (CF3). The electron-withdrawing CF3 deshields adjacent protons, shifting their signals downfield. The splitting pattern here (if resolved) would reflect the meta/para substitution pattern of the ring. A peak at ~6 ppm could arise from the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the ether oxygen (OCH2) in the side chain, as oxygen deshields nearby protons. The peak at ~5 ppm is tentatively assigned to the CH proton in the central carbon chain (CH(COc1...)), which is influenced by both the adjacent oxygen and the hydrazone double bond (=N–N). The methoxy groups (OCH3) attached to phosphorus are expected around 3.5–4 ppm, though they may overlap with other signals or appear as a singlet if equivalent. Notably, the spectrum lacks significant peaks in the aliphatic region (0–3 ppm), consistent with the absence of non-functionalized alkyl chains. The CF3 group itself does not contribute to the H-NMR spectrum, as it contains no protons. Overall, the spectral features align with the structural motifs of the molecule: deshielded NH protons, aromatic signals influenced by CF3, and oxygen-adjacent aliphatic protons. Further analysis of coupling constants and integration would provide additional insights into proton connectivity and stoichiometry."

Key observations include: 1. **Carbonyl carbons**: Two prominent peaks at ~170 ppm and ~168 ppm correspond to the amide carbonyl groups (C=O) in the molecule. These high-field shifts are characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons in amide functionalities, reflecting electron-withdrawing effects from adjacent nitrogen atoms. 2. **Aromatic carbons**: Multiple signals between 120–140 ppm arise from the aromatic rings in the biphenyl and pyridine moieties. The broad distribution of peaks in this region indicates chemically distinct aromatic carbons, including those adjacent to substituents (e.g., the methyl group on the terminal phenyl ring) and those in the electron-deficient pyridine ring (~150 ppm). 3. **Aliphatic carbons**: A sharp peak at ~21 ppm is attributed to the methyl group (-CH₃) on the para-substituted benzene ring. Additionally, signals near 50 ppm and 30 ppm correspond to the methylene (-CH₂-) groups in the pyrrolidine ring and the ethylene linker (-CH₂-CO-) adjacent to the pyridine ring, respectively. 4. **Quaternary carbons**: Resonances near 140–150 ppm likely represent quaternary aromatic carbons, such as the ipso-carbons in the biphenyl system and the pyridine C-2/C-6 positions, which are deshielded due to conjugation and nitrogen electronegativity. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s diverse carbon environments, with clear differentiation between sp³-hybridized aliphatic carbons, sp²-hybridized aromatic/olefinic carbons, and carbonyl carbons. The absence of signals below 10 ppm or above 180 ppm confirms the absence of aldehyde/ketone functionalities or highly deshielded carbons beyond the observed amides. This C-NMR data aligns with the proposed structure, providing evidence for the biphenyl core, amide linkages, and heterocyclic pyridine and pyrrolidine rings."

Bromine's characteristic isotopic pattern is evident in several fragments, with peaks separated by 2 m/z units due to the nearly equal natural abundance of ⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br. For instance, the doublet at m/z 150 and 152 (relative abundance ~1:1) suggests a fragment retaining bromine, likely resulting from the loss of a C₃H₅O moiety (43 Da, possibly an acetyl group) from the molecular ion. Similarly, the doublet at m/z 125 and 127 (less intense) may correspond to a smaller brominated fragment, such as C₂HBrS (calculated m/z: 125.9 for ⁷⁹Br), formed via further cleavage of the thiophene ring. Additional significant peaks include m/z 81, which aligns with the mass of a thiophene-derived fragment (C₄H₅S⁺, 81.1 Da), likely generated by cleaving the acetyl and bromine substituents. The peak at m/z 178 may represent the loss of a methyl group (15 Da) from the molecular ion, while m/z 186 could arise from a rearrangement or oxidation product. The absence of a strong peak at m/z 204 (M−15) suggests limited methyl group loss compared to other fragmentation pathways. The spectrum highlights the stability of the molecular ion, with the base peak at m/z 219 indicating minimal fragmentation under the ionization conditions. Bromine's isotopic signature in multiple fragments confirms its presence in the original structure. The observed peaks collectively support the assigned structure of 2-acetyl-4-bromo-5-methylthiophene, with fragmentation patterns typical of brominated heterocycles and ketone functionalities."

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption features consistent with the molecular structure. A prominent broad peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to N-H stretching vibrations of the secondary amide group (Boc-protected amine), while weaker peaks in the 2900–2800 cm⁻¹ region are attributed to C-H stretching of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. The sharp, intense band at ~1710 cm⁻¹ is diagnostic of the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group. Additional peaks near 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1500 cm⁻¹ arise from aromatic C=C stretching modes in the benzene and pyridine rings. A distinct absorption at ~1250 cm⁻¹ reflects C-O stretching of the ether linkages in the morpholine and Boc groups. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex patterns from C-N stretching, C-S vibrations in the thiazole ring, and skeletal deformations of the heterocyclic systems. The absence of broad O-H bands confirms the lack of free hydroxyl groups, while the lack of strong absorptions near 2200 cm⁻¹ indicates no nitrile or alkyne functionalities.

The spectrum displays correlations between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, with ¹H chemical shifts (ppm) on the x-axis (14 to -2 ppm) and ¹³C chemical shifts (ppm) on the y-axis (0 to -200 ppm). Key features include: 1. **Carboxylic Acid Region**: A prominent peak at ~¹H 12 ppm and ¹³C ~-170 ppm corresponds to the highly deshielded proton of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and its directly bonded carbonyl carbon. This is consistent with the strong electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent oxygen atoms, shifting both nuclei downfield. 2. **Aromatic Protons and Carbons**: Peaks at ~¹H 11–10 ppm and ¹³C ~-160 to -155 ppm arise from aromatic protons in the heteroaromatic quinoxaline core (nc1-nc2), where the proximity of electronegative nitrogen atoms deshields both the protons and their attached carbons. Additional aromatic correlations at ~¹H 6–7 ppm and ¹³C ~-120 to -130 ppm likely correspond to protons and carbons in the phenyl ring (-c1ccccc1) and less deshielded positions of the quinoxaline system. 3. **Alkyl Groups**: A peak at ~¹H 2 ppm and ¹³C ~-10 ppm represents the terminal methyl groups (-CH3) of the ethyl substituents on the nitrogen atom. These exhibit upfield shifts typical of aliphatic methyl groups. A weaker correlation at ~¹H 3 ppm and ¹³C ~-50 ppm may correspond to the methylene (-CH2-) groups adjacent to the nitrogen, where deshielding by the electronegative nitrogen shifts both nuclei downfield relative to the methyl groups. 4. **Quaternary Carbons**: The carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid and other quaternary carbons (e.g., aromatic carbons bonded to nitrogen or the phenyl ring) do not appear in the HSQC spectrum, as HSQC only detects correlations with directly attached protons. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the carboxylic acid, aromatic systems, and ethyl substituents. The observed chemical shifts reflect the electronic environment dictated by the molecule’s functional groups and heteroatoms."

The spectrum displays three distinct cross-peaks, indicating direct correlations between proton (1H) and carbon (13C) nuclei in the molecule. The peaks are observed at approximately: 1. **6 ppm (1H) / 50 ppm (13C)** 2. **3 ppm (1H) / 30 ppm (13C)** 3. **2 ppm (1H) / 20 ppm (13C)** These features reflect the molecular structure and electronic environment of the protons and carbons. The peak at 50 ppm (13C) corresponds to a carbon atom deshielded by electronegative substituents, likely the carbon adjacent to the sulfur atom and the amide group (C-S-C(N)=O). Its correlated proton at 6 ppm (1H) is significantly downfield, suggesting proximity to electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., sulfur or the amide carbonyl). The peak at 30 ppm (13C) and 3 ppm (1H) is consistent with a methylene (CH2) or methine (CH) group near the sulfur atom, where the sulfur’s inductive effect shifts the signals downfield. The final peak at 20 ppm (13C) and 2 ppm (1H) aligns with a methyl group (CH3) attached to a carbon with moderate electron density, such as the terminal methyl in the SC(C)C(N)=O fragment. Notably, the amide carbonyl carbon (C=O) at ~170–180 ppm is absent in the HSQC spectrum, as expected, since it lacks directly bonded protons. The observed peaks collectively confirm the connectivity of the molecule, with the oxime (C=N-OH), thioether (S-CH), and amide (C(N)=O) functionalities influencing the chemical shifts. This HSQC spectrum provides critical insights into the spatial and electronic relationships between protons and carbons, supporting the assigned structure."

The spectrum displays characteristic features of a heteroaromatic system with fluorinated substituents. The most prominent peak appears at approximately 12.0 ppm, corresponding to the carboxylic acid proton (COOH), which is typically highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and electron withdrawal from the adjacent carbonyl group. A distinct singlet at ~10.0 ppm is observed, likely arising from the aromatic proton on the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine ring (position 3), which is strongly deshielded by the electron-deficient nitrogen-rich heterocycle. A multiplet centered near 8.5 ppm integrates to two protons, assignable to the aromatic protons on the benzyl-substituted pyrimidine ring (positions 5 and 7), influenced by the electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl group (CF3) on the phenyl ring. The fluorinated phenyl ring itself contributes a complex multiplet between 7.5–8.0 ppm, with the ortho-proton to the CF3 group appearing as a doublet due to coupling with the fluorine atom (J ≈ 7–9 Hz). The meta-proton to the CF3 group typically resonates slightly upfield as a triplet, while the para-proton to the fluorine substituent appears as a doublet near 7.2 ppm. A sharp singlet at ~4.5 ppm corresponds to the two benzylic protons (CH2) linking the heterocycle to the fluorophenyl ring, deshielded by the adjacent aromatic system. The trifluoromethyl group (CF3) does not produce direct H-NMR signals but induces significant downfield shifts in nearby protons via its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. The fluorine substituent on the phenyl ring (para to CH2) further modulates the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons through both inductive and ring-current effects. Overall, the spectrum reflects the structural complexity of the molecule, with distinct regions for the carboxylic acid, heteroaromatic, benzylic, and fluorinated aromatic protons. The absence of signals below 6 ppm suggests no aliphatic protons are present outside the benzylic CH2 group. This H-NMR profile aligns with the molecular formula C15H9F4N3O2, confirming the presence of nine aromatic/unsaturated protons and two benzylic protons in the specified chemical environments."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption features consistent with the structural motifs present in this molecule. A prominent, sharp peak at approximately 1650 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the urea functional group, which is a defining feature of this compound. This absorption is slightly shifted from the typical range for urea carbonyls (1620–1680 cm⁻¹) due to hydrogen bonding interactions between the urea NH groups and adjacent electron-rich regions. A broad, moderate-intensity band near 3300 cm⁻¹ arises from N–H stretching vibrations in the urea moiety, with its width reflecting strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The asymmetric and symmetric C–H stretching vibrations of the aliphatic alkyl chains (pentyl and isopropyl groups) are evident as sharp peaks between 2850–2960 cm⁻¹. These peaks are split due to the different environments of the methylene (CH₂) and methyl (CH₃) groups in the branched alkyl substituents. Aromatic C–H stretching vibrations appear as weaker absorptions just above 3000 cm⁻¹ (3020–3100 cm⁻¹), while the methylenedioxy group (O–CH₂–O) contributes to a distinct peak near 1250 cm⁻¹, corresponding to C–O stretching. Additional bands in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) include aromatic C–C ring vibrations and out-of-plane C–H bending modes, which are consistent with the substituted benzene rings in the structure. The absence of a strong absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of free carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones or esters), supporting the presence of the hydrogen-bonded urea functionality. The spectrum’s overall pattern aligns with the molecular framework, providing evidence for the connectivity of the aromatic rings, urea linkage, and aliphatic side chains. These features collectively validate the structural assignment of the compound based on its IR spectral profile."

The spectrum displays correlations between proton (¹H) and directly bonded carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts, revealing key structural features of the molecule. The ¹H chemical shifts span from approximately 14 ppm to -2 ppm, while the ¹³C shifts range from 200 ppm to 0 ppm. Several distinct cross-peaks are observed. A prominent peak near 10 ppm (¹H) and 190 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the aldehyde group (C=O), consistent with the deshielded proton and carbonyl carbon in the furan ring. Peaks in the 8–9 ppm (¹H) and 140–160 ppm (¹³C) region likely arise from aromatic protons and carbons in the heterocyclic ring, reflecting the electron-withdrawing effects of the nitrogen and oxygen substituents.

The spectrum exhibits minimal signal overlap, suggesting a well-resolved analysis of the molecule’s protonated carbons. The absence of peaks in certain regions (e.g., above 200 ppm for ¹³C) confirms the lack of additional carbonyl or quaternary carbons beyond those specified in the structure.

Additional strong signals in the 150–160 ppm range are attributed to aromatic carbons bonded to oxygen (e.g., the methoxy-substituted carbons on the leftmost benzene ring and the pyridine ring’s oxygen-linked carbon). The region between 110–140 ppm contains multiple peaks of moderate intensity, consistent with aromatic carbons in the fluorinated benzene ring (c4c(F)ccc(F)c4F) and the pyridine ring (nccc). The fluorine substituents on the benzene ring induce downfield shifts for adjacent carbons due to their strong electron-withdrawing effects, likely contributing to peaks near 130–140 ppm. The methoxy carbons (O–CH3) appear as a distinct peak around 50–60 ppm, reflecting their shielding in the aliphatic region. Notably, the spectrum lacks significant peaks below 50 ppm, indicating the absence of non-aromatic aliphatic carbons beyond the methoxy groups. The distribution of peaks aligns with the molecular symmetry and substitution pattern in the SMILES structure, particularly the two methoxy groups on the left benzene ring and the urea-linked fluorinated aromatic system. This C-NMR spectrum effectively highlights the molecule’s structural complexity, including its conjugated aromatic systems, heteroatoms, and functional group diversity."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 12–6 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of hydrogen atoms in this heterocyclic structure. The most downfield peak at ~12 ppm corresponds to a highly deshielded aromatic proton, likely adjacent to both the electron-withdrawing chlorine atom and the nitrogen atom in the quinoline ring system. This extreme deshielding arises from the combined effects of the electronegative substituents and the aromatic ring current. A second prominent peak at ~10 ppm suggests another deshielded aromatic proton, possibly positioned ortho to the nitrogen in the pyridine-like ring, where the electron-deficient environment further reduces electron density around the nucleus. Two overlapping peaks near ~8 ppm are characteristic of protons in the benzodioxole moiety (OCH2O), where the oxygen atoms induce moderate deshielding. These signals likely represent the two equivalent methylene protons of the dioxole ring, though their exact position may be influenced by ring strain and coupling with adjacent aromatic protons. The peak at ~6 ppm corresponds to the vinyl group’s protons (C=CH2), which appear upfield relative to aromatic signals due to the electron-donating nature of the double bond. The splitting pattern here suggests minimal coupling, consistent with a terminal alkene geometry. The absence of signals below 5 ppm indicates no aliphatic protons are present, aligning with the rigid aromatic and heterocyclic framework of the molecule. The integration of peak intensities (not explicitly shown but inferred from relative heights) supports the presence of one deshielded aromatic proton (12 ppm), one moderately deshielded aromatic proton (10 ppm), two benzodioxole methylene protons (8 ppm), and two vinyl protons (6 ppm), totaling seven of the ten hydrogens in the formula. The remaining three hydrogens likely correspond to aromatic protons on the quinoline ring, which may overlap with the benzodioxole signals or appear as weaker features in the 7–9 ppm range. This spectrum exemplifies how electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, N) and aromatic systems create distinct chemical environments, enabling structural elucidation through H-NMR analysis."

The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 446, which corresponds to the intact molecule [M]+. This base peak confirms the molecular weight of 446 g/mol, consistent with the provided formula. Several significant fragment ions are observed, providing insights into the compound's structural features. A cluster of peaks at m/z 365, 366, and 367 (relative intensities ~40–50%) suggests the loss of a 81 Da fragment from the molecular ion. This mass difference corresponds to the elimination of HCl and a neutral fragment (e.g., HCl + CO), consistent with the presence of both chlorine and carbonyl groups in the structure. The isotopic pattern of these peaks (e.g., 365/367 ratio ~3:1) reflects the chlorine atom’s natural isotopic abundance (³⁵Cl/³⁷Cl). Additional fragment ions at m/z 227, 228, and 229 (relative intensities ~15–20%) indicate further decomposition, likely involving cleavage of the sulfonamide (–SO₂NH₂) group. The 227/229 isotopic pair (again ~3:1) confirms the retention of the chlorine atom in this fragment. This pattern aligns with the benzoxazine core (C12H8ClN3O2S) after cleavage of the phenyl-sulfonamide moiety. A moderate peak at m/z 165 (relative intensity ~10%) corresponds to the benzoxazine-4-one fragment (C10H7N2O2), formed via N–C bond cleavage between the oxazine ring and the sulfonamide-substituted phenyl group. Lower-abundance peaks between m/z 200–300 (e.g., 201, 203, 215, 291, 292) arise from sequential losses of small neutral species (e.g., NH3, CO, H2O) and rearrangements typical of heterocyclic systems. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 446 confirms the molecular ion’s stability under the ionization conditions. The observed fragmentation pattern supports the proposed structure, particularly the presence of the sulfonamide, chlorophenyl, and benzoxazine groups. This spectrum exemplifies characteristic mass spectrometric behavior for heterocyclic sulfonamides, with diagnostic chlorine isotopic signatures and predictable bond cleavages."

The most prominent signal appears as a singlet at ~7.5 ppm, integrating to two protons, which are assigned to the aromatic hydrogens on the 3,4-dichlorobenzamide moiety. The electron-withdrawing chlorine substituents and the adjacent amide group deshield these protons, shifting their resonance downfield. A sharp singlet at ~3.2 ppm (three protons) corresponds to the methyl group of the methanesulfonate (mesyl) ester, which is highly deshielded due to the electronegative sulfur and oxygen atoms. A triplet at ~3.8 ppm (two protons) is attributed to the methylene group (-CH2-) in the glycine linker adjacent to the amide nitrogen. This signal is split by coupling with the neighboring amide proton, though the coupling may appear collapsed due to exchange broadening. A multiplet at ~4.5 ppm (two protons) arises from the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the oxygen atom in the pyrrolidine ring. The oxygen’s electronegativity deshields these protons, shifting their resonance to a higher ppm value. The pyrrolidine ring protons exhibit overlapping multiplets between ~2.5–1.8 ppm, integrating to eight protons, consistent with the four methylene groups in the five-membered ring.

    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C18H13N3O2S (SMILES: O=C1NN=C/C1=C1\\C=C(Sc2ccccc2O)c2ccccc2N1). The spectrum exhibits several key features characteristic of its functional groups and molecular structure. In the region between 3400–3200 cm⁻¹, a broad, moderately intense band is observed, likely corresponding to the O–H stretching vibration of the phenolic hydroxyl group (Sc2ccccc2O) and potentially overlapping N–H stretches from the hydrazone moiety (NN=C). This broadness suggests hydrogen bonding, typical of hydroxyl groups in aromatic systems. A sharp, intense peak near 1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the ketone group (O=C1), a hallmark of the molecule’s lactam-like structure. Adjacent to this, a peak around 1600 cm⁻¹ may arise from C=N stretching of the hydrazone (NN=C) or conjugated C=C bonds in the aromatic rings. The aromatic C–H stretching vibrations are evident in the 3100–3000 cm⁻¹ range, with sharp peaks indicating sp²-hybridized C–H bonds in the benzene rings. In the fingerprint region (1500–600 cm⁻¹), multiple peaks reflect complex vibrational modes of the aromatic systems and heteroatom-containing bonds. Notably, a peak near 1250 cm⁻¹ could correspond to C–O stretching of the phenolic ether (C–O–S), while bands below 1000 cm⁻¹ may involve C–S stretching (S–C) or out-of-plane aromatic C–H deformations. The absence of significant absorption near 2200 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of nitrile or isocyanate groups, aligning with the given structure. Overall, the spectrum reflects the molecule’s conjugated aromatic system, carbonyl functionality, and heteroatom substitutions, providing insights into its structural motifs without ambiguity."

    "text": "This is an IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C15H32O2S (SMILES: CCCCCCCCCCCCSCC(O)CO). The spectrum exhibits several key features characteristic of its functional groups and molecular structure. The broad absorption band centered near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the O-H stretching vibrations of the two hydroxyl (-OH) groups present in the molecule. This band is moderately intense and slightly asymmetric, suggesting hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxyl groups. Sharp peaks in the 2900–2850 cm⁻¹ region are attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching vibrations of the long aliphatic carbon chain (C12H25), with the most prominent peaks at 2920 cm⁻¹ (asymmetric CH₂ stretch) and 2850 cm⁻¹ (symmetric CH₂ stretch). A weaker C-H stretching band near 2960 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of terminal methyl groups. A distinct peak at 1050 cm⁻¹ is consistent with C-O stretching vibrations, likely arising from the primary alcohol moiety (CH₂OH). The thioether linkage (C-S) is evidenced by a moderate absorption near 700 cm⁻¹, which aligns with typical S-C stretching frequencies. Additional bending vibrations in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) include C-C skeletal deformations and O-H bending modes. The absence of strong absorption bands near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of carbonyl (C=O) functionality, consistent with the provided structure. The overall spectral profile supports the identification of a long-chain aliphatic thioether diol, with no significant impurities or unexpected functional groups detected in the sample."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C9H14N2O (SMILES: O[C@H]1CCCC[C@@H]1c1cn[nH]c1). The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm. The most prominent peak appears at approximately 50 ppm, which likely corresponds to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (C-OH) in the cyclohexane ring. This carbon is deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen atom, placing it in the mid-field region of the spectrum. Additional peaks at ~100 ppm and ~150 ppm are consistent with aromatic or heteroaromatic carbons, likely originating from the pyrazole ring (c1cn[nH]c1) in the structure. These shifts reflect the electron-deficient environment of the sp²-hybridized carbons in the five-membered ring containing nitrogen atoms. A minor peak near 200 ppm suggests the presence of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), though the provided SMILES does not include a ketone or aldehyde group. This discrepancy may indicate an impurity, a minor tautomeric form, or an artifact in the spectrum. The absence of signals in the 10–40 ppm range, where aliphatic CH₂ groups typically resonate, is notable. However, the cyclohexane ring’s methylene carbons (C2–C5 in the ring) may overlap with the baseline or exhibit low intensity due to rapid molecular motion or symmetry. The sharp peak at 0 ppm corresponds to the tetramethylsilane (TMS) reference standard, used for calibration. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected features of the given structure, including the hydroxyl-bearing cyclohexane and pyrazole ring, though the 200 ppm peak warrants further investigation. The integration and multiplicity of peaks would provide additional insights into the molecular environment, but this analysis focuses solely on the observed chemical shifts and their qualitative interpretation."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks characteristic of the molecular ion and its fragmentation pattern. The base peak at m/z 377 corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the molecular weight of 376 g/mol for C19H15F3N2O3. A prominent peak at m/z 359 suggests a loss of 18 Da (H2O), likely indicating the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in the structure. Another significant peak at m/z 333 corresponds to a loss of 44 Da (CO2), further supporting the carboxylic acid functionality. Fragmentation at m/z 313 (loss of 64 Da) may arise from cleavage of the cyclopropyl group (C3H4) or rearrangement involving the triazole ring. Peaks at m/z 215 and 233 likely originate from the fluorinated benzyl ether moiety (OCc2c(F)ccc(F)c2F), with the latter potentially representing a combination of the triazole ring (C3H2N2) and fluorinated aromatic fragment. The peak at m/z 188 could correspond to the triazole-cyclopropane fragment (C6H5N2F3), while m/z 145 may represent the fluorinated benzyl cation (C7H4F3+). The isotopic pattern of fluorine (3:1 ratio for 19F) is subtly reflected in the relative intensities of peaks at m/z 377 and 379, consistent with the presence of three fluorine atoms. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 377 confirms the molecular ion as the highest-mass species. The spectrum demonstrates typical fragmentation pathways for heterocyclic aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing substituents, such as fluorine and carboxylic acid groups. These features align with the structural motifs in the provided SMILES notation, including the triazole ring, fluorinated benzyl ether, and cyclopropane substituent. The data collectively validate the molecular formula and structural assignment through diagnostic fragmentation patterns."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the unique carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak, appearing near 170 ppm, is characteristic of the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (C=O), which is highly deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen atoms. Adjacent to this, a sharp peak around 120 ppm corresponds to the nitrile carbon (C≡N), which is also deshielded by the triple bond to nitrogen. The aromatic region (120–140 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks, reflecting the six carbons of the benzene ring. These peaks arise from the varying electronic environments of the ortho, meta, and para carbons relative to the substituent (CH(C#N)CH(COOH)), with the quaternary aromatic carbon (attached to the alkyl chain) typically appearing slightly downfield of the CH carbons. In the aliphatic region (0–60 ppm), peaks near 50 ppm and 30 ppm are observed. The 50 ppm peak corresponds to the methine carbon (CH) bonded to both the nitrile and the benzene ring, while the 30 ppm peak represents the methylene carbon (CH2) adjacent to the carboxylic acid group. A smaller peak near 15 ppm likely corresponds to the methyl group (CH3) attached to the central carbon framework. The spectrum’s peak multiplicities and chemical shifts align with the structural features of 2-cyano-3-phenylbutanoic acid, confirming the presence of distinct functional groups and their spatial arrangement."

Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm ¹H, 120–140 ppm ¹³C):** Peaks in this region correspond to protons and carbons in the pyridine and triazole rings. The cross-peaks at ~7.5–8.0 ppm (¹H) and ~130–140 ppm (¹³C) are consistent with aromatic CH groups in the pyridine moiety (c1ccn2nc...), while signals near 7.0–7.5 ppm (¹H) and 120–130 ppm (¹³C) likely arise from the triazole ring (c1cnn(C)c1...). 2. **Amide Proton Region (8–10 ppm ¹H, 160–170 ppm ¹³C):** A distinct cross-peak at ~9.5 ppm (¹H) and ~165 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the amide proton (Nc1ccn2...) and its carbonyl carbon.

The spectrum confirms the connectivity of protons to their respective carbons, validating the proposed structure. The distribution of peaks aligns with the aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic components of the molecule, including the pyrrolidine, triazole, pyridine, and ethyl ester functionalities.

This peak likely arises from the cleavage of the dioxolane ring (C3OCCO3) in the molecular structure, resulting in a stable fragment retaining the benzene ring and part of the oxygen-containing framework. A significant peak at m/z 156, with ~35% relative abundance, suggests a fragment formed via loss of a C2H4O2 unit (60 Da) from the molecular ion, consistent with the expulsion of a neutral ethylene carbonate or similar moiety. Additional notable peaks include m/z 91 (tropylium ion, ~20% abundance), indicative of a benzyl-type fragment, and m/z 100 and 103 (both ~25% abundance), which may correspond to smaller fragments involving the dioxolane ring or oxygenated hydrocarbon chains. The molecular ion (M+) is not observed in this spectrum, which is common for electron ionization (EI) mass spectrometry of thermally labile or highly fragmented compounds. Peaks at m/z 155 and 157 (~15% and ~10% abundance, respectively) likely represent isotopic contributions (e.g., ¹³C or ¹⁸O) or minor fragmentation pathways. The absence of high-mass peaks beyond m/z 157 further supports extensive fragmentation of the parent ion. The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, particularly the labile oxygen-containing rings and the aromatic system, which stabilize specific cleavage products.

The downfield 13C shifts (~170 ppm) correspond to the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (C-1), which lacks a directly attached proton and thus does not produce a cross-peak in HSQC. Additional cross-peaks in the aliphatic region (2–4 ppm for 1H and 20–60 ppm for 13C) arise from the bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane moiety, specifically the methylene (C-6, C-7) and methine (C-8) carbons and their associated protons.

A sharp peak near 130 ppm is assigned to the aromatic carbon bonded to the iodine substituent on the phenyl ring, as halogens induce significant deshielding effects. Two overlapping peaks in the 125–128 ppm range likely represent the aromatic carbons ortho and meta to the iodine atom, while the peak at 115 ppm corresponds to the nitrile carbon (C≡N), which typically resonates in this region due to its triple-bonded nature. A resonance at 110 ppm is attributed to the carbon adjacent to the hydroxyl group (-OH) in the thiazole ring, where the electronegative oxygen slightly deshields the nucleus.

Additional high-frequency resonances between 140–160 ppm are attributed to aromatic carbons in the pyridine and pyrimidine rings, particularly those bonded to nitrogen or fluorine atoms, which further deshield the nuclei. A cluster of peaks between 100–140 ppm reflects the remaining aromatic carbons in the heterocycles and the benzyl-substituted indole ring system.

The presence of two adjacent chlorine substituents on the aromatic ring introduces additional complexity, with C–Cl stretching vibrations appearing as sharp, medium-intensity bands in the 700–850 cm⁻¹ region. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains numerous peaks, including C–N stretching (near 1250 cm⁻¹) and aromatic C–H bending modes, which are consistent with the meta/para-substituted chlorinated benzene framework. Notably, the absence of broad O–H absorptions (3200–3600 cm⁻¹) confirms the lack of hydroxyl groups, while the lack of alkyne or nitrile stretches (2100–2250 cm⁻¹) aligns with the saturated succinimide and aromatic components. The observed spectral features collectively validate the structural motifs of the chlorinated benzyl-succinimide derivative."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C7H5ClINO (SMILES: NC(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(I)c1). The spectrum displays several key peaks that align with the molecular structure and its fragmentation pattern. The most prominent peak at m/z 282 corresponds to the molecular ion (M⁺), confirming the molecular weight of 282 g/mol. This peak serves as the base peak, indicating high stability of the intact molecule under ionization conditions. Adjacent to the molecular ion, a peak at m/z 265 (relative abundance ~20%) represents the loss of ammonia (NH₃, 17 Da), a common fragmentation pathway for amide-containing compounds. This suggests cleavage of the amide group, yielding a fragment retaining the aromatic ring, chlorine, and iodine substituents. A significant peak at m/z 155 (relative abundance ~40%) arises from the loss of iodine (I, 127 Da), leaving a fragment with the formula C₇H₅ClNO. The presence of chlorine in this fragment is supported by a minor isotope peak at m/z 157 (not explicitly labeled but implied by the Cl isotopic pattern). A smaller peak at m/z 154 may correspond to further loss of a hydrogen atom ([M - I - H]⁺). The peak at m/z 246 (relative abundance ~15%) indicates the loss of hydrogen chloride (HCl, 36.5 Da), suggesting cleavage of the C-Cl bond. This fragment likely retains the iodine and amide group, with a minor isotope peak at m/z 247 possibly due to natural ¹³C abundance. Two peaks at m/z 119 and 120 (relative abundance ~10% each) likely represent a fragment containing the amide group and part of the aromatic ring, such as C₇H₅NO⁺ (calculated m/z 119). The adjacent peak at 120 may arise from isotopic contributions (e.g., ¹³C or ¹⁵N) or a related structural rearrangement. Smaller peaks at m/z 118 and 120 (not labeled) could correspond to further fragmentation of the aromatic system or isotopic variants. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 100 suggests limited decomposition of the core structure under the ionization conditions used. Overall, the spectrum reflects the stability of the molecular ion and characteristic fragmentation pathways of halogenated aromatic amides, including losses of NH₃, HCl, and iodine, consistent with the given molecular formula and structure."

The spectrum exhibits a prominent base peak at m/z 375, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated monoisotopic mass of 375.0 (C17H12BrFN2O2: 12×17 + 1×12 + 79.9×1 + 19.0×1 + 14.0×2 + 16.0×2 = 375.0). The presence of bromine is confirmed by the characteristic isotope pattern: a minor peak at m/z 377 (approximately 98% relative abundance compared to m/z 375) due to the 79Br/81Br isotopic ratio. Key fragment ions are observed at m/z 347, 329, 330, 331, 301, and 302. The peak at m/z 347 (relative abundance ~20%) suggests a loss of 28 Da from the molecular ion, likely attributed to cleavage of the ethyl ester group (C2H4O, 44 Da) followed by decarboxylation (-CO2, 44 Da) or direct loss of ethylene (C2H4, 28 Da). The cluster of peaks at m/z 329, 330, and 331 (relative abundances ~5–10%) indicates further fragmentation involving the brominated aromatic ring, with the 329/331 pair reflecting the bromine isotope signature. The peak at m/z 330 may arise from a minor isotopic contribution (e.g., 13C incorporation) or a distinct fragmentation pathway. The ions at m/z 301 and 302 (relative abundances ~15%) likely result from additional losses of small neutral molecules such as CO (28 Da) or H2O (18 Da) from earlier fragments. For example, m/z 301 could correspond to [M+H – CO2 – C2H4O]+, while m/z 302 may retain a hydrogen rearrangement. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 300 suggests that the core quinazoline structure (retaining the Br and F substituents) remains intact in the major fragments. Overall, the spectrum reflects the stability of the molecular ion under ionization conditions, with fragmentation primarily occurring at the ester functionality and the brominated aromatic ring. The isotopic patterns confirm the presence of bromine, while the fragment ions align with plausible retro-synthetic pathways of the quinazoline-ester scaffold."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), three prominent peaks are observed at approximately 120, 115, and 110 ppm. These correspond to the carbons in the substituted benzene ring, with the downfield shifts (higher ppm values) attributed to the electron-withdrawing effects of the bromine and chlorine substituents. The peak at ~120 ppm likely represents the carbon directly bonded to bromine, while the peak at ~110 ppm may correspond to the carbon adjacent to the sulfur atom in the indole ring system. In the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm), multiple peaks are visible at ~40, 30, 25, and 20 ppm. The peak at ~40 ppm is consistent with the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the sulfur atom in the Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-S linkage, as sulfur deshields nearby carbons. The peaks at ~30 and ~25 ppm likely arise from the middle methylene groups in the propyl chain, while the peak at ~20 ppm may correspond to the terminal CH2Cl group. The absence of peaks above 160 ppm indicates no carbonyl or highly deshielded sp2 carbons outside the aromatic system. The spectrum’s peak intensities and multiplicities align with the molecular symmetry and substitution pattern. The aromatic region’s complexity reflects the non-equivalent carbon environments in the fused indole-benzene system, while the aliphatic peaks confirm the presence of the flexible propylthio chain.

The spectrum displays a molecular ion peak at m/z 276, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the molecular weight of the compound (275.34 g/mol). The base peak at m/z 163 indicates a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the amide bond (C–N) adjacent to the carbonyl group, resulting in a fragment containing the benzamide moiety (C9H9NO2) and a portion of the ethylcyclopentyl side chain. This fragmentation pattern is typical for amides under electron ionization, where homolytic cleavage generates stable acylium ions. Key fragments include peaks at m/z 230 and 232, which may represent [M – CO2]+ (loss of carbon dioxide from the carboxylic acid group) and its isotopic variant, respectively. The peak at m/z 147 suggests further fragmentation of the benzamide-derived ion, potentially involving loss of the methyl group or rearrangement. Additional notable peaks at m/z 91 (tropylium ion) and 105 (benzoyl ion) confirm the presence of an aromatic ring with substituents. Smaller peaks at m/z 83, 117, and 119 correspond to aliphatic fragments from the cyclopentyl or ethyl groups. The peak at m/z 258 may indicate a neutral loss of 18 Da (e.g., water) from the molecular ion, though this is less common for carboxylic acids unless dehydration occurs during ionization. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern aligns with the structure of a substituted benzamide bearing a carboxylic acid and an ethylcyclopentyl group, with dominant cleavage pathways reflecting the stability of aromatic and carbonyl-containing fragments. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 276 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity, while the distribution of lower-m/z peaks provides insight into the compound’s structural motifs."

Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (120–160 ppm):** - A prominent peak at ~155 ppm is attributed to aromatic carbons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing ester carbonyl groups (ortho to COO–). - Peaks at ~130 ppm and ~120 ppm correspond to aromatic carbons meta and para to the ester groups, as well as carbons ortho to the electron-donating amino groups (NH₂), which experience shielding effects. - The splitting of aromatic signals reflects the asymmetric substitution pattern on each benzene ring (amino and ester groups in ortho positions), creating distinct chemical environments. 2. **Carbonyl Region (~170 ppm):** - A sharp, high-intensity peak at ~170 ppm is characteristic of the ester carbonyl carbons (C=O). The equivalence of both ester groups in the symmetric hexane chain results in a single peak. 3. **Aliphatic Region (10–70 ppm):** - A peak at ~60 ppm corresponds to the methylene carbons (CH₂) directly bonded to the ester oxygens (O–CH₂), which are deshielded by the adjacent electronegative oxygen. - Peaks at ~30 ppm and ~25 ppm represent the remaining methylene groups (CH₂) in the hexane chain. The slight shift differences arise from their relative positions: carbons closer to the ester groups (e.g., CH₂ adjacent to O–CH₂) appear slightly downfield (~30 ppm), while central CH₂ groups in the chain resonate upfield (~25 ppm). 4. **Absence of Peaks in Specific Regions:** - No signals are observed above 180 ppm, confirming the absence of ketone or carboxylic acid carbonyls. - The lack of peaks below 10 ppm indicates no methyl groups (CH₃) are present, consistent with the hexane chain terminating in ester linkages. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, with distinct chemical shifts reflecting the aromatic substitution pattern, ester functionalities, and aliphatic chain. The symmetry of the molecule simplifies the spectrum, as equivalent carbons in the two aromatic rings and hexane chain produce overlapping signals."

The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances across a chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, consistent with the structural complexity of the molecule. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–9 ppm):** A prominent multiplet near 8 ppm corresponds to aromatic protons on the fluorinated quinoline and benzene rings. The fluorine substituent (¹⁹F, I=½) induces spin-spin coupling with adjacent protons, evident as doublets or doublets of doublets in this region. The deshielding effect of the electronegative fluorine atom shifts these protons downfield. Additional aromatic protons appear as overlapping multiplets between 7–7.5 ppm, reflecting the fused ring system. 2. **Aliphatic Region (0.5–4 ppm):** A triplet at ~2 ppm (J ≈ 7.5 Hz) and a quartet at ~1.2 ppm suggest a terminal ethyl group (–CH₂CH₃), likely from the butyl side chain (CCCC) or the [C@]3(O)CC moiety. The integration and splitting align with the presence of two distinct methyl/methylene environments. 3. **Oxygen-Bearing Protons:** A broad singlet near 4.5 ppm may correspond to the hydroxyl proton (–OH) at the stereocenter ([C@]3(O)CC), though its exact position could be obscured by solvent effects or hydrogen bonding. 4. **Carbonyl-Adjacent Protons:** Peaks near 5 ppm (doublet, J ≈ 15 Hz) and 3.5 ppm (multiplet) likely arise from protons on the –CH₂– group adjacent to the lactam carbonyl (c(=O)n1C2) and the ester (COC(=O)). 5. **Low-Intensity Peaks:** Minor signals between 10–12 ppm may indicate trace impurities or exchangeable protons (e.g., residual water or acidic impurities), as no strongly acidic protons are present in the target structure. The spectrum reflects the molecule’s rigid polycyclic framework, with limited conformational flexibility leading to well-resolved peaks. The fluorine atom’s influence on neighboring protons and the stereocenter’s hydroxyl group are critical for interpreting the splitting patterns and chemical shifts.

The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances across a broad chemical shift range, reflecting the molecule's structural complexity. Key features include: 1. **Downfield Region (10–14 ppm):** A prominent singlet near 13 ppm is observed, likely corresponding to the hydroxylamine proton (-CONHOH), which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and electronegative oxygen/nitrogen atoms. A smaller peak around 12 ppm may arise from an exchangeable proton, possibly a sulfonamide NH (though the SMILES lacks a free NH, suggesting minor impurities or tautomeric forms). 2. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm):** Two multiplets near 7 ppm integrate to ~2H, consistent with the thiophene ring protons. The substitution pattern (butyl and piperidine groups at adjacent positions) splits these signals, with deshielding from the electron-withdrawing sulfonamide group shifting them downfield compared to unsubstituted thiophene (~6.5–7.0 ppm). 3. **Aliphatic Region (0–5 ppm):** - **4–5 ppm:** A sharp peak near 4 ppm likely represents the methylene protons (CH₂) adjacent to the morpholine oxygen (CCOCC), deshielded by the electronegative oxygen. - **2.5–3.5 ppm:** Multiple resonances in this range correspond to piperidine ring protons (CH₂ groups adjacent to the sulfonamide nitrogen) and morpholine CH₂ groups. The intense peak at ~2 ppm may overlap signals from the piperidine and morpholine rings, as well as the butyl chain’s β-CH₂. - **1–2 ppm:** Peaks here likely arise from the butyl chain’s γ-CH₂ and δ-CH₃ groups, with the terminal methyl appearing as a triplet near 0.9 ppm (not distinctly visible in the image but implied by the structure). 4. **Integration and Splitting:** The spectrum’s peak intensities align with the 30 protons in the formula. The hydroxylamine and thiophene protons (3H total) are distinct in the downfield/aromatic regions, while the remaining 27H populate the aliphatic region. Splitting patterns (e.g., triplets, multiplets) are consistent with coupled protons in the butyl, piperidine, and morpholine rings, though specific coupling constants are not resolved here. This spectrum highlights the molecule’s functional diversity, with deshielding effects from the sulfonamide, hydroxylamine, and thiophene groups creating distinct chemical environments. The absence of signals beyond 14 ppm confirms no aldehyde or carboxylic acid protons, while the lack of broad peaks above 10 ppm (other than 13 ppm) suggests minimal proton exchange artifacts. Overall, the H-NMR data aligns well with the proposed structure, validating the molecular formula and connectivity."

Another singlet at 10.5 ppm corresponds to the two exchangeable protons of the aromatic amino group (-NH2) on the benzene ring. In the aromatic region, a doublet at 8.5 ppm (integration ~1H) arises from the pyridine ring proton at position 6, which is ortho to the ring nitrogen and deshielded by its electronegativity.

The 7.5 ppm signals include the pyridine proton at position 3 (ortho to the acetamide group) and the meta protons on the benzene ring relative to the amino group. The 6.0 ppm doublet corresponds to the benzene ring protons ortho to the amino group, which are shielded by the electron-donating effect of -NH2.

The most downfield cross-peak appears at approximately 10 ppm (¹H) and 100 ppm (¹³C), indicative of an aromatic proton-carbon pair. This resonance is consistent with the deshielded environment of the aromatic ring in the molecule, where the electron-withdrawing effects of the three fluorine substituents and the amine group (-NH₂) significantly shift the chemical shifts downfield. The second cross-peak at ~6 ppm (¹H) and ~120 ppm (¹³C) also corresponds to an aromatic proton-carbon pair, likely from a position on the ring less directly influenced by the fluorine substituents but still experiencing aromatic ring current effects. The third cross-peak at ~4 ppm (¹H) and ~15 ppm (¹³C) represents the aliphatic methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the sulfur atom (SCH₃). The upfield ¹³C shift of this methyl group is characteristic of carbons bonded to sulfur, while the ¹H shift reflects the shielding effect of the adjacent sulfur atom. The HSQC spectrum confirms the presence of three distinct protonated carbon environments in the molecule: two aromatic carbons and one aliphatic methyl carbon. The absence of additional cross-peaks aligns with the molecular formula, as the remaining carbons in the aromatic ring are either quaternary (non-protonated) or substituted with fluorine atoms, which do not produce HSQC correlations.

Additional peaks in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) include a cluster of absorptions between 1200–1300 cm⁻¹, likely arising from C–O stretching vibrations in the carboxylic acid and ether (C–O–C) linkages. The aromatic C–H stretching vibrations are visible as weaker peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹, consistent with the substituted benzene rings in the structure.

The spectrum displays several prominent peaks that provide insights into the molecular structure and fragmentation pathways. The molecular ion peak [M]+ is observed at m/z 250, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the compound. A minor peak at m/z 251 represents the M+1 isotope peak, attributed to the natural abundance of ¹³C and ¹⁵N isotopes. The base peak at m/z 233 corresponds to the loss of a hydroxyl radical (OH, 17 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for carboxylic acid-containing compounds. This suggests the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a key site for initial fragmentation. Additional significant peaks include m/z 218 (loss of 32 Da from the molecular ion, potentially corresponding to CO₂ + H₂), m/z 213 (loss of 37 Da, possibly HF + CO), and m/z 206 (loss of 44 Da, indicative of CO₂ elimination).

For instance, m/z 113 could represent a fluorinated benzene ring fragment (C₆H₃F₂N), while m/z 152 might correspond to a pyridine-derived fragment retaining the amino group. The presence of two fluorine atoms influences the fragmentation pattern, as evidenced by the absence of significant peaks corresponding to HF elimination in some pathways. The stability of the aromatic systems and the electron-withdrawing effects of the fluorine substituents likely contribute to the observed fragmentation trends. The spectrum confirms the molecular integrity of the compound and highlights characteristic decomposition routes tied to its functional groups and aromatic framework."

The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 452, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 452.52 g/mol. The base peak at m/z 353 represents the most abundant fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the amide bond in the isobutyryl side chain (C4H7O, 71 Da loss), yielding a fragment retaining the pyrimidine core, triazole ring, and fluorophenylthio group. Additional significant peaks at m/z 434 and 394 suggest sequential losses of small neutral molecules, possibly H2O (18 Da) or NH3 (17 Da), from the molecular ion or larger fragments. The peaks at m/z 225, 245, and 258 correspond to further fragmentation of the triazole and pyrimidine rings. The m/z 258 peak may represent the benzotriazole-thioether fragment (C12H8FN4S), while m/z 225 and 245 could arise from partial degradation of this moiety. Peaks at m/z 366 and 368, separated by 2 Da, indicate the presence of sulfur isotopes (32S and 34S) in a fragment, likely originating from the thioether linkage (S-C6H4F). The m/z 394 peak may result from a rearrangement or loss of a C5H5N2O fragment. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the labile amide bond, the electron-rich triazole ring, and the sulfur-containing substituent. The spectrum provides critical insights into the compound’s stability under ionization and the susceptibility of specific bonds to cleavage, aiding in structural confirmation."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C9H10BrNO (SMILES: Cc1cc(Br)c2c(c1)NCCO2). The spectrum displays key correlations between proton (1H) and carbon (13C) chemical shifts, characteristic of the heteronuclear single quantum coherence technique. The observed peaks reveal distinct regions corresponding to aromatic, aliphatic, and heteroatom-adjacent environments. In the aromatic region, the 1H shifts between 6.5–7.5 ppm correlate with 13C shifts of 110–140 ppm, consistent with the substituted benzene ring in the structure. The bromine substituent likely induces deshielding, shifting the adjacent aromatic protons and carbons to lower fields. A prominent peak near 7.0 ppm (1H) and 130 ppm (13C) may correspond to the protonated aromatic carbon meta to the bromine. The methyl group (C in Cc1cc...) appears as a distinct cross-peak at ~2.3 ppm (1H) and ~20 ppm (13C), typical for a CH3 group attached to an sp2-hybridized carbon. The NCCO2 moiety generates correlations in the aliphatic region. The CH2 groups adjacent to nitrogen and oxygen exhibit downfield shifts due to the electronegative atoms: one set of peaks near 3.5 ppm (1H) and 55 ppm (13C) likely corresponds to the methylene (CH2) bonded to nitrogen, while another near 4.0 ppm (1H) and 65 ppm (13C) may arise from the oxygen-adjacent CH2. These shifts reflect the combined inductive effects of N and O. The spectrum lacks signals for quaternary carbons, such as the carbon bearing the bromine or the oxygen-bridged aromatic carbon, as HSQC only detects carbons directly bonded to protons. The absence of peaks in the 100–120 ppm (13C) range suggests no sp2-hybridized carbons without attached protons in this region. Overall, the HSQC data aligns with the proposed structure, providing direct evidence of the connectivity between protonated carbons and their respective hydrogens, while highlighting the electronic influence of the bromine, nitrogen, and oxygen substituents on the chemical shifts."

A broad, intense peak near 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of N-H stretching vibrations, likely from the primary amide (NC=O) and amine (NH₂) groups. The sharp, strong absorption at ~1600 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of the amide moiety, which is slightly shifted to lower wavenumbers due to conjugation with adjacent aromatic systems. Additional medium-intensity peaks between 1500–1600 cm⁻¹ correspond to aromatic C=C stretching vibrations from the phenyl and heterocyclic rings.

The base peak at m/z 116 indicates the molecule exhibits moderate stability under electron ionization conditions. Notable fragment ions are observed at m/z 98, 83, and 53. The peak at m/z 98 arises from the loss of water (H2O, 18 Da), a common fragmentation pathway for alcohols, suggesting the hydroxyl group in the piperidine ring undergoes dehydration. The fragment at m/z 83 corresponds to a further loss of a methyl group (CH3, 15 Da) from the m/z 98 ion, consistent with the presence of the N-methyl substituent in the SMILES structure. The m/z 53 peak likely results from a ring cleavage event, generating a smaller, stable fragment such as a C4H5+ ion or a related hydrocarbon fragment. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 116 confirms the molecular ion assignment, while the low abundance of intermediate fragments suggests limited structural complexity.

The spectrum displays characteristic features of a saturated aliphatic amine with distinct chemical environments. A prominent singlet at ~2.0 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (CH3) attached to the quaternary carbon (C1) of the pyrrolidine ring. This signal is slightly downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent nitrogen atom in the ring. A broad multiplet centered at ~3.0 ppm arises from the two methylene groups (CH2) directly bonded to the nitrogen atom in the pyrrolidine ring. These protons experience deshielding from the electronegative nitrogen and exhibit complex splitting due to coupling with neighboring protons. Additional multiplets between 1.0–2.0 ppm represent the remaining methylene protons in both the pyrrolidine and cyclohexyl rings. The cyclohexyl protons (C1–C6) appear as overlapping signals in this region, reflecting their conformational flexibility and axial/equatorial equilibria. The pyrrolidine ring’s methylene groups (C3 and C4) also contribute here, with slight upfield shifts compared to the N-adjacent CH2 groups. A minor singlet near 4.0 ppm may correspond to the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the nitrile (CN) substituent on C1, though its low intensity suggests limited proton count or partial overlap with other signals. The absence of aromatic or olefinic signals (δ > 5 ppm) confirms the fully saturated nature of the molecule. The integration ratios (not explicitly shown) would align with the 12 aliphatic protons in the cyclohexyl ring, 8 protons in the pyrrolidine ring, and 3 protons from the methyl group, consistent with the molecular formula.

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule's diverse carbon environments. The most prominent peak appears near 175 ppm, characteristic of carbonyl carbons in carboxylic acids or amides. This aligns with the molecule's carboxylic acid group (C(=O)O) and two amide functionalities (NC(=O) and c(=O)[nH]2), which typically resonate in this region due to deshielding by electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Additional intense peaks between 160–170 ppm likely correspond to the carbonyl carbon in the pyridone ring (c(=O)[nH]2), which is slightly upfield compared to the carboxylic acid due to resonance stabilization. Aromatic carbons dominate the 100–150 ppm range, with multiple peaks reflecting the two benzene rings (c1ccc(-c2...)cc1 and c2ccc...). These shifts are consistent with substituted aromatic systems, where electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., amides, carboxylic acids) deshield adjacent carbons. The pyridone ring’s nitrogen further influences the chemical shifts of its adjacent carbons, creating distinct resonances. In the aliphatic region (20–60 ppm), peaks near 55 ppm and 30 ppm correspond to the CH and CH2 groups in the side chain (CC[C@H](N)). The CH carbon (adjacent to the amino group) appears downfield due to the inductive effect of the electronegative nitrogen, while the CH2 carbons resonate at lower shifts.

The spectrum exhibits several key features characteristic of the described structure. The most prominent peak occurs at ~4.0 ppm as a singlet with high intensity, likely corresponding to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the amide carbonyl in the NC(=O)CH2-Cnaphthyl fragment. This downfield shift from typical aliphatic protons (0.9–2.5 ppm) reflects deshielding by the electron-withdrawing amide group and conjugation with the naphthalene ring. A sharp peak at ~6.0 ppm, also a singlet, suggests a vinylic proton from the conjugated enamine system (/C=C/), where the double bond is flanked by the dimethylamino group and the ketone. This region aligns with expected vinylic shifts (5–7 ppm), though the exact position is influenced by resonance stabilization and substituent effects. Notably, the spectrum displays multiple low-intensity peaks between 10.0–13.5 ppm, an unusually downfield region typically associated with highly deshielded protons such as those in strong hydrogen bonds or acidic environments. These may arise from the amide NH proton, which is often broad and variable but here appears split into multiple signals, possibly due to conformational isomerism (e.g., cis/trans amide rotamers) or intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Thiophene ring protons (expected ~6.5–7.5 ppm) are not distinctly visible, likely obscured by overlapping signals or low resolution. The absence of peaks in the aldehyde/ketone region (9–10 ppm) confirms no free carbonyl protons, consistent with the structure. The naphthalene ring protons (expected 7.0–8.5 ppm) may contribute to unresolved multiplets in the 7–9 ppm range, though their intensity is minimal, suggesting either rapid aromatic ring rotation or overlap with baseline noise. Overall, the spectrum reflects key structural motifs: the deshielded methylene, conjugated vinylic proton, and dynamic amide NH environment, all consistent with the assigned molecular framework. Further analysis with 2D NMR or solvent suppression would clarify ambiguous assignments."

The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 203, corresponding to the intact molecular mass of C9H10N6 (calculated monoisotopic mass: 202.1 Da, observed as 203 due to protonation or isotopic contributions). The base peak at m/z 203 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Notable fragment ions are observed at m/z 188, 187, 163, 150, 149, 133, 117, 108, 107, 100, and 93, with relative abundances decreasing progressively from the molecular ion. The peak at m/z 188 (188/203) suggests loss of a neutral fragment of 15 Da, consistent with cleavage of a methyl group (CH3, 15 Da) from the molecular ion. The adjacent peak at m/z 187 may represent a further loss of 1 Da (e.g., a hydrogen atom), indicating sequential fragmentation. The m/z 163 peak (loss of 40 Da from the molecular ion) could correspond to the elimination of a C2H4N group (40 Da) from the triazene or pyridazine rings in the structure. Fragment ions at m/z 150 and 149 (loss of 53 Da and 54 Da, respectively) likely arise from cleavage of the central C–C bond between the two heterocyclic rings, generating fragments containing either the methylpyridazine (C5H6N3, 111 Da) or triazene (C4H4N3, 110 Da) moieties. The m/z 133 peak (loss of 70 Da) may result from the elimination of a C4H6N2 unit, while the m/z 117 peak (loss of 86 Da) could involve the loss of a larger fragment such as C5H8N3. The lower-m/z peaks at m/z 108, 107, 100, and 93 correspond to smaller, more stable fragments. For instance, m/z 93 (C4H5N4, 93 Da) may represent a pyrimidine-like fragment, while m/z 100 (C5H8N2, 100 Da) could derive from a rearrangement of the triazene ring. The m/z 107 peak (C6H7N2, 107 Da) might indicate a tropylium-like ion or a stabilized aromatic fragment. The isotopic pattern of the molecular ion (m/z 203) shows no significant satellite peaks, confirming the absence of elements with strong isotopic signatures (e.g., chlorine or bromine). The fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the SMILES notation, particularly the two nitrogen-rich heterocycles, which are prone to cleavage under electron ionization. The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms contributes to the stability of fragment ions via resonance or charge delocalization. Overall, the spectrum supports the proposed molecular formula and structure, with fragmentation pathways reflecting the decomposition of the heterocyclic cores and peripheral substituents. The high abundance of the molecular ion and the systematic loss of small neutral fragments are consistent with the compound’s aromatic and nitrogen-rich nature."

The presence of a cis-configured C=C double bond is indicated by a moderate absorption band near 1650 cm⁻¹, accompanied by weaker out-of-plane bending vibrations around 970 cm⁻¹. Aliphatic C-H stretching vibrations produce multiple sharp peaks between 2800–3000 cm⁻¹, with the asymmetric and symmetric stretches of the long hydrocarbon chain clearly resolved. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex absorption patterns from C-O stretching (1050–1300 cm⁻¹) and O-H bending (1400–1450 cm⁻¹) vibrations, as well as skeletal C-C vibrations. The absence of significant absorption above 3500 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of free (non-hydrogen-bonded) hydroxyl groups, while the lack of peaks near 2200 cm⁻¹ indicates no nitrile or alkyne functionalities. These spectral features collectively align with the structural features of the provided molecule, including its hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, and unsaturated alkene components."

The spectrum displays characteristic peaks corresponding to the proton environments in the structure. In the aliphatic region (0–3 ppm), a triplet at ~0.9 ppm (integration ~3H) is attributed to the terminal methyl group (CH3) of the butyl chain. Adjacent methylene (CH2) groups appear as multiplets at ~1.3 ppm (~2H) and ~1.6 ppm (~2H), reflecting their distinct coupling interactions. The methylene group directly bonded to the nitrogen (CH2N) resonates downfield at ~3.1 ppm (~2H) due to deshielding by the electronegative nitrogen. A singlet at ~2.3 ppm (~3H) corresponds to the aromatic methyl group (Ar-CH3) on the benzene ring. In the aromatic region (6.5–7.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the substituted benzene ring’s proton environments. The chlorine and methyl substituents create an asymmetric substitution pattern, leading to non-equivalent aromatic protons. Peaks at ~6.6 ppm, ~6.8 ppm, ~7.0 ppm, and ~7.2 ppm (total integration ~3H) correspond to the three aromatic protons. The splitting patterns and chemical shifts suggest a combination of ortho- and meta-coupled protons, consistent with the 1,2,4-substitution pattern (amine, chlorine, and methyl groups). The most downfield peak (~7.2 ppm) likely arises from a proton ortho to both the electron-withdrawing chlorine and the amine group, experiencing strong deshielding. The spectrum’s features align with the proposed structure, with peak integrations matching the expected number of protons in each environment. The absence of additional peaks confirms the purity of the sample and the correctness of the assigned structure."

The region between 2900–3000 cm⁻¹ shows weaker peaks attributable to aliphatic C–H stretches from the cyclopentyl (OC2CCCC2) moiety. Notably, the spectrum exhibits a distinct band near 1600 cm⁻¹, which may correspond to C=N stretching vibrations from the oxime (C=N–O) or thiazole (ns1) ring. Additional peaks in the 1400–1500 cm⁻¹ range could arise from N–O stretching or ring vibrations in the thiazole heterocycle. A moderate absorption near 1200 cm⁻¹ may reflect C–O stretching in the oxime ether linkage. The fingerprint region (<1000 cm⁻¹) contains multiple sharp peaks, likely due to complex vibrations involving the sulfur-containing thiazole ring and cyclopentyl substituent. The absence of prominent peaks above 3500 cm⁻¹ indicates minimal interference from N–H stretching of the amine (Nc1), possibly due to hydrogen bonding or spectral overlap with the O–H band.

The spectrum exhibits four distinct proton environments, consistent with the molecular structure. The most downfield peak at approximately 10.5 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton (–COOH), which appears as a broad singlet due to hydrogen bonding and rapid exchange with trace water or deuterated solvent. Adjacent to this, a sharp singlet at ~2.5 ppm integrates to three protons, assigned to the methyl group (–CH3) attached to the pyridine ring. This signal is slightly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent aromatic system and the positively charged nitrogen in the pyridine N-oxide moiety. In the aromatic region, two sets of doublets are observed. The doublet at ~8.5 ppm (integration ~1H) and a corresponding doublet at ~7.5 ppm (integration ~1H) arise from the two non-equivalent protons on the pyridine ring. These protons are coupled to each other via vicinal (3-bond) coupling, with the downfield shift of the former attributed to its proximity to the electron-withdrawing N-oxide group. The fluorophenyl ring contributes two additional doublets at ~7.8 ppm and ~7.2 ppm (each integrating to 2H), characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. The fluorine substituent induces a strong deshielding effect on the ortho protons, causing their downfield shift relative to the meta/para positions. The absence of additional peaks confirms the lack of impurities or solvent signals in the spectrum.

A prominent singlet near 10 ppm suggests a highly deshielded proton, likely the amide NH group involved in hydrogen bonding, which shifts downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl group. This is consistent with the molecule's amide functionality. A cluster of peaks between 7.2–8.2 ppm corresponds to aromatic protons from both the naphthyl (c1ccc2ccccc2c1) and phenyl (c1ccccc1) rings. These protons exhibit typical aromatic chemical shifts, with the naphthyl protons appearing slightly more downfield due to the extended conjugated system.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides a two-dimensional correlation between directly bonded carbon and hydrogen atoms, with the x-axis representing 1H chemical shifts (0–14 ppm) and the y-axis representing 13C chemical shifts (0–200 ppm). The spectrum reveals distinct clusters of cross-peaks that correspond to specific structural features of the molecule. In the aliphatic region (1H: 0–3 ppm; 13C: 10–60 ppm), several cross-peaks are observed. These peaks likely arise from the ethyl groups (CH2CH3) attached to the nitrogen atom in the CCN(CC) moiety, as well as the cyclohexyl ring (C1CCNCC1). The ethyl groups typically exhibit 1H shifts around 1–3 ppm and 13C shifts near 10–20 ppm (CH3) and 40–60 ppm (CH2).

A second prominent cluster appears in the aromatic region (1H: 6–8 ppm; 13C: 100–150 ppm). These cross-peaks correspond to the aromatic protons and carbons in the two benzene rings (c1ccccc1 and c2ccccc2) and the oxazine-linked aromatic system. The 1H shifts in this range are characteristic of aromatic protons, while the 13C shifts reflect the sp2-hybridized carbons in the aromatic framework. The oxazine ring’s oxygen-substituted carbon (Oc1ccccc1) may contribute to the upfield edge of this region (13C ~120–130 ppm), whereas the more downfield shifts (~140–150 ppm) likely originate from quaternary aromatic carbons or those adjacent to electronegative substituents. Notably, the spectrum lacks cross-peaks in the carbonyl region (13C >160 ppm), consistent with the absence of carbonyl groups in the structure. The imine group (C=N) in the SMILES notation may contribute to a weak cross-peak near 13C ~150–160 ppm and 1H ~8–9 ppm, though such signals are often less intense in HSQC due to shorter relaxation times. Overall, the HSQC spectrum effectively maps the protonated carbons in the molecule, enabling correlation of specific 1H and 13C signals to structural motifs such as aliphatic amines, ethyl groups, and aromatic systems. This data is critical for assigning the connectivity of atoms in the molecule and validating the proposed structure."

Key observations include: 1. **Carboxylic Acid Proton (COOH):** A sharp singlet near 12.5 ppm indicates the acidic proton of the carboxylic acid group. This downfield shift arises from strong deshielding by the adjacent electronegative oxygen atoms. 2. **Aromatic Region (6.5–8.5 ppm):** Multiple peaks in this range correspond to the aromatic protons on the three phenyl rings. The fluorine substituents induce distinct splitting patterns due to spin-spin coupling (J-coupling) with adjacent protons. For example: - A doublet near 8.0 ppm (J ≈ 8.0 Hz) likely represents protons ortho to the fluorine on the terminal phenyl ring (c2cccc(F)c2), split by the fluorine nucleus. - A triplet near 7.5 ppm (J ≈ 7.5 Hz) may arise from protons meta to fluorine, with coupling to neighboring protons. - Peaks between 7.0–7.3 ppm correspond to the amine-linked phenyl ring (c1ccc(F)cc1), where fluorine splitting and meta/para coupling patterns are evident. 3. **Amine Proton (NH):** A broad singlet near 10.5 ppm suggests the presence of the NH group, which undergoes hydrogen bonding and rapid exchange, leading to a downfield shift and peak broadening. 4. **Integration Ratios:** The relative peak areas align with the 13 aromatic protons (13H) and 1 carboxylic acid proton (1H) in the formula. For instance, the singlet at 12.5 ppm integrates to 1H, while the aromatic peaks collectively integrate to ~13H. 5. **Fluorine Effects:** The two fluorine atoms (¹⁹F) deshield adjacent protons, causing downfield shifts and characteristic coupling patterns.

The spectrum displays a dominant molecular ion peak at m/z 423, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. This peak represents the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, confirming the molecular formula. Several significant fragment ions are observed at m/z 395, 310, 275, 234, 232, 182, 104, and 103, with relative abundances decreasing progressively from the base peak at 423. The peak at m/z 395 (100% relative abundance) suggests a loss of 28 Da from the molecular ion, likely corresponding to the elimination of a neutral fragment such as CO or C2H4. The fragment at m/z 310 may arise from cleavage of the oxygen-containing heterocyclic ring, retaining the nitrile-substituted aromatic moiety (c4cccc(C#N)c4). The pair of peaks at m/z 234 and 232 (with a 3:1 intensity ratio) indicates the presence of a chlorine atom in a minor isotopic variant, though the primary molecular formula does not include chlorine. This anomaly could stem from a co-eluting impurity or a metastable transition artifact.

Smaller fragments at m/z 182 and 104 suggest further breakdown of the aromatic systems, with the latter potentially corresponding to a benzyl-type cation (C7H7+) from the phenyl substituent (c3ccccc3). The peak at m/z 103 may represent a dehydrogenated variant of this fragment. The high-resolution mass data align with the proposed SMILES structure, particularly the presence of the nitrile group (C#N) and the fused bicyclic core. The fragmentation pattern reflects typical behavior for nitrogen- and oxygen-containing heterocycles, with charge retention on the most electron-rich fragments. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 423 confirms the molecular weight, while the distribution of lower-m/z fragments supports the structural complexity inferred from the SMILES notation. This spectrum provides critical evidence for the molecular integrity and fragmentation pathways of C26H22N4O2 under electron ionization conditions."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C18H19BrO2 (SMILES: CC(C)(C)OC(=O)c1c(CBr)cccc1-c1ccccc1). The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating ¹H and ¹³C chemical shifts for directly bonded proton-carbon pairs. Key features include three distinct regions of signal intensity. First, a cluster of peaks between 7.5–8.0 ppm (¹H) and 125–130 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to aromatic protons and their attached carbons in the two benzene rings. These signals reflect the deshielding effects of the aromatic system and the electronic influence of substituents, including the electron-withdrawing ester group and bromomethyl substituent. Second, a prominent cross-peak at ~5.5 ppm (¹H) and ~30 ppm (¹³C) arises from the benzylic CH₂ group adjacent to the bromine atom. The downfield proton shift (5.5 ppm) indicates strong deshielding by the electronegative bromine, while the carbon shift (~30 ppm) aligns with a sp³-hybridized carbon in a bromomethyl environment. Third, a singlet-like peak at ~1.5 ppm (¹H) and ~28 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the tert-butyl group’s methyl protons and their attached carbons. The upfield proton and carbon shifts reflect the electron-donating nature of the tert-butyl group and its lack of conjugation. Notably, the spectrum lacks signals in the carbonyl region (~160–180 ppm for ¹³C), consistent with the absence of directly bonded protons to the ester carbonyl carbon. The observed peaks collectively confirm the presence of aromatic, benzylic, and aliphatic environments in the molecule, with chemical shifts consistent with the provided structure. The HSQC data effectively maps proton-carbon connectivity, validating the molecular framework of CC(C)(C)OC(=O)c1c(CBr)cccc1-c1ccccc1."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption features consistent with the molecular structure, which contains a cyclohexane ring substituted with a tert-butyl group and a sulfonate ester functional group. Key spectral features include: 1. **C-H Stretching Region (2800–3000 cm⁻¹):** A series of sharp, medium-intensity peaks in this region correspond to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of aliphatic C-H bonds in the tert-butyl group and cyclohexane ring. The absence of broad O-H or N-H stretches confirms the lack of hydroxyl or amine groups. 2. **Sulfonate Ester Vibrations (1000–1300 cm⁻¹):** Two prominent peaks at ~1200 cm⁻¹ and ~1050 cm⁻¹ are attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the S=O bonds in the sulfonate ester group (O-S(=O)₂-O). These bands are intense and diagnostic for sulfonate-containing compounds. A weaker band near 1150 cm⁻¹ may arise from C-O-S stretching vibrations, further supporting the presence of the ester linkage. 3. **Fingerprint Region (<1000 cm⁻¹):** Complex, low-intensity peaks in this region likely originate from bending vibrations of the cyclohexane ring, C-C deformations in the tert-butyl group, and S-O-C bending modes. The lack of strong absorption above 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the absence of carbonyl (C=O) or nitro (N=O) groups. The observed spectral features align with the molecular structure, where the sulfonate ester group dominates the mid-infrared region, while aliphatic C-H and C-C vibrations contribute to the fingerprint and C-H stretching regions. This IR spectrum provides clear evidence for the functional groups and structural motifs defined by the formula C11H22O3S."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides a two-dimensional correlation between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the structure. The spectrum displays distinct cross-peaks corresponding to specific ¹H-¹³C pairs, with the ¹H chemical shift (ppm) on the x-axis and the ¹³C chemical shift (ppm) on the y-axis. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic region (6–8 ppm, ¹H; 100–160 ppm, ¹³C):** Multiple cross-peaks are observed in this region, consistent with the presence of aromatic protons and their attached carbons. The fluorine-substituted benzene ring (Cc1cc(F)ccc1N) likely contributes peaks near 7.0–7.5 ppm (¹H) and 110–130 ppm (¹³C), reflecting deshielding effects from the electronegative fluorine atom. The pyridine-like nitrogen in the c1cc2c(cn1)ncn2C moiety may further shift adjacent protons downfield (7.5–8.5 ppm) due to ring current effects. 2. **Aliphatic region (0–3 ppm, ¹H; 10–40 ppm, ¹³C):** Cross-peaks in this area correspond to the ethyl group (CCc1...) and N-methyl substituents. The terminal methyl of the ethyl group is expected near 1.2 ppm (¹H) and 15 ppm (¹³C), while the N-methyl groups (N(C)c1... and ncn2C) likely appear at ~3.0 ppm (¹H) and 35–40 ppm (¹³C), reflecting their electron-donating nature. 3. **Heteroaromatic protons (7.5–8.5 ppm, ¹H; 130–150 ppm, ¹³C):** The imidazole-like ring (nc[nH]2C) and pyridine nitrogen in the fused bicyclic system generate cross-peaks in this range, with protons adjacent to nitrogen atoms appearing downfield due to deshielding. The spectrum lacks peaks for quaternary carbons (e.g., the fluorinated aromatic carbon or carbons bonded to nitrogen without attached protons), as HSQC selectively detects only ¹H-¹³C pairs. The absence of fluorine-¹³C couplings is expected, as HSQC does not directly observe heteronuclear couplings involving fluorine. Overall, the observed cross-peaks align with the structural features of C16H17FN4, confirming the presence of aromatic, aliphatic, and heteroaromatic components as described by the SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays characteristic peaks corresponding to the protons in distinct chemical environments of the molecule. The aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks, reflecting the presence of three aromatic rings: two phenyl groups (one from the N-phenyl substituent and one from the biphenyl system) and a benzamide moiety. These peaks appear as overlapping multiplets due to complex coupling patterns typical of substituted aromatic systems. A prominent singlet near 7.8 ppm likely corresponds to the amide proton (N-H) of the benzamide group, though its exact position may vary slightly due to hydrogen bonding. A sharp singlet at ~2.3 ppm integrates to three protons, consistent with the methyl group attached to the piperazine ring (N-CH3). Additional aliphatic signals include a triplet near 3.5 ppm (2H, CH2 adjacent to the piperazine nitrogen) and a multiplet at ~1.5–1.8 ppm (2H, CH2 in the pentyl chain). The terminal methyl group of the pentyl chain appears as a triplet at ~0.9 ppm (3H, CH3). A distinct peak at ~4.5 ppm (2H) corresponds to the benzyl CH2 group linking the N-phenyl and biphenyl moieties, deshielded by the adjacent nitrogen and aromatic systems. The spectrum also shows smaller peaks in the 2.5–3.2 ppm range, likely from the piperazine ring’s CH2 protons and the methylene groups in the pentyl chain. The absence of broad peaks beyond the aromatic region suggests no exchangeable protons (e.g., OH or additional NH) are present. Integration ratios align with the molecular structure, confirming the distribution of protons across aromatic, aliphatic, and functional group environments. This H-NMR spectrum effectively highlights the molecule’s structural complexity, including its aromaticity, amide functionalities, and aliphatic side chains."

Notably, a cluster of peaks near 8.5 ppm (¹H) and 140 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to deshielded protons on the pyridine ring adjacent to nitrogen atoms, while peaks near 7.2–7.8 ppm (¹H) and 120–130 ppm (¹³C) likely arise from the indole and phenyl groups. In the aliphatic region (0.5–4 ppm in ¹H, 10–70 ppm in ¹³C), correlations are observed for the isopropyl group (δH ~1.3 ppm, δC ~22 ppm for methyl carbons; δH ~4.8 ppm, δC ~70 ppm for the methine carbon) and the cyclopentane ring fused to the indole (δH ~2.0–3.0 ppm, δC ~30–40 ppm). The carboxylic acid proton (COOH) does not appear in the HSQC spectrum, as expected, since it is attached to oxygen rather than carbon. Additionally, the oxadiazole ring (c2nc(-c3ccc4[nH]c5c(c4c3)CCC5CC(=O)O)no2) contributes minimal HSQC signals due to its lack of directly bonded protons. The spectrum also highlights a distinct peak near 10 ppm (¹H) and 120 ppm (¹³C), which may correspond to a proton on a deshielded aromatic carbon, potentially near the oxadiazole or pyridine nitrogen. The overall distribution of cross-peaks aligns with the molecular framework, confirming the presence of conjugated aromatic systems, aliphatic side chains, and heterocyclic components. This HSQC data provides critical insights into the connectivity and electronic environment of protons and carbons, supporting the structural assignment of the molecule."

The spectrum displays four distinct proton signals, which can be interpreted based on the molecular structure. The most downfield signal at ~13 ppm corresponds to a highly deshielded proton on the thiazole ring, likely adjacent to the sulfur atom, influenced by the electron-withdrawing nitro group. A signal at ~11 ppm is attributed to the second thiazole proton, which is also deshielded but to a lesser extent. The peak at ~10 ppm represents the vinyl proton (CH) directly bonded to the carbon bearing the nitro group, experiencing strong deshielding due to the nitro group's inductive effect. Finally, the signal at ~4 ppm corresponds to the remaining vinyl proton (CH2), which is less deshielded and appears upfield. The absence of signals in the aliphatic region (e.g., <2 ppm) confirms the lack of isolated methyl or methylene groups beyond those involved in the conjugated system. These observations align with the proposed structure, where the nitro group and thiazole ring create distinct electronic environments for the protons, leading to their characteristic chemical shifts."

The spectrum displays characteristic chemical shifts that align with the structural features of the compound. The most prominent peak appears near 0 ppm, which is unusually low and likely corresponds to the methyl carbons of the tert-butyl ester group (OC(=O)C(CH3)3), as these carbons are typically shielded due to their aliphatic nature and proximity to the oxygen atom. Additional peaks in the 20–30 ppm range may further support the presence of tert-butyl methyl groups, though they are less intense in this spectrum. A distinct peak near 50 ppm is observed, which could correspond to the quaternary carbon of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group (OC(=O)N), as such carbons often resonate in the 50–80 ppm region due to their attachment to electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The aromatic carbons of the fluorophenyl ring (c2ccc(F)cc2) are evident in the 110–140 ppm range, with the fluorine substituent causing deshielding and splitting of adjacent carbons. Specifically, the carbon directly bonded to fluorine (ipso carbon) typically appears downfield (140–160 ppm), while meta and para carbons resonate between 110–130 ppm. The alkene carbons of the C=C double bond in the piperidine ring (CC=C) are likely responsible for peaks in the 120–140 ppm range, consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons. A notable peak near 150 ppm may correspond to the carbonyl carbon of the Boc group (OC(=O)N), which typically resonates between 150–160 ppm. The ester carbonyl (OC(=O)C(CH3)3) is expected near 170 ppm, though this region is not prominently featured in the spectrum, possibly due to overlap or lower intensity. The spectrum’s high-intensity peak at 0 ppm and the absence of signals above 200 ppm suggest the dominance of aliphatic and aromatic features over highly deshielded carbonyl or quaternary carbons. The fluorine atom’s influence is subtly reflected in the aromatic region, though its direct coupling to carbon is not resolved here. Overall, the spectral features corroborate the presence of tert-butyl ester and Boc groups, a fluorophenyl ring, and an unsaturated piperidine ring, consistent with the provided molecular structure."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 287, which corresponds to the intact molecular weight of the compound. The presence of bromine is confirmed by the characteristic isotope pattern: a secondary peak at m/z 289 (not explicitly labeled in the spectrum but implied by the molecular formula) with approximately 98% relative abundance compared to the monoisotopic peak at 287, reflecting the natural abundance of Br-79 and Br-81 isotopes. The base peak at m/z 287 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Fragmentation pathways are evident through several significant peaks. A notable peak at m/z 272 (287 – 15 Da) suggests loss of a methyl group (CH3), likely from the methylpyridine moiety. Another major fragment at m/z 208 (287 – 79 Da) corresponds to the loss of bromine (Br), consistent with cleavage of the C–Br bond in the indole ring system. This is followed by a peak at m/z 207 (208 – 1 Da), which may arise from further loss of a hydrogen atom. Additional fragments include m/z 193 (208 – 15 Da) and 192 (193 – 1 Da), indicating sequential losses of a methyl group and hydrogen from the bromine-free indole-pyridine framework. A peak at m/z 154 may represent a stable fragment derived from the indole-pyridine core, potentially retaining the nitrogen atoms. The peak at m/z 115 could correspond to a pyridine-derived fragment, such as a methylpyridine cation (C6H6N+), which is a common stable structure in aromatic nitrogen-containing compounds. Minor peaks at m/z 234 and 233 suggest less abundant fragmentation pathways, possibly involving rearrangements or losses of small neutral molecules (e.g., HCN or C2H2). The overall fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule: a methylpyridine group linked to a brominated indole ring. The stability of the molecular ion and the prominence of bromine-related fragmentation are consistent with the electron-rich aromatic system and the presence of heteroatoms (N) that stabilize charge during ionization.

The most prominent peak, observed at m/z 295, corresponds to the molecular ion (M⁺), confirming the molecular weight of 295 g/mol calculated for C13H8Cl₂N₂S. This peak serves as the base peak, indicating its high stability under ionization conditions. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 268, 259, 232, 224, 227, 125, and minor fragments in the lower m/z range. The peak at m/z 268 likely arises from the loss of a chlorine atom (Cl, 35.5 Da) from the molecular ion, forming [M−Cl]⁺. The adjacent peak at m/z 259 may result from the elimination of hydrogen chloride (HCl, 36.5 Da), consistent with the molecule’s two chlorine substituents. The presence of chlorine isotopes (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl) is evident in the minor peaks at m/z 260 and 262, which align with the expected isotopic distribution for fragments containing one or two chlorine atoms. The peaks at m/z 224 and 227 exhibit a 3 Da separation, characteristic of fragments retaining a single chlorine atom, where the heavier isotope (³⁷Cl) contributes to the higher m/z value. These fragments likely originate from cleavage of the thienopyrimidine ring system, retaining portions of the aromatic framework. The peak at m/z 125 represents a stable fragment, possibly corresponding to a benzothiophene-derived cation after cleavage of the pyrimidine ring and loss of substituents. The peak at m/z 232 may correspond to a rearrangement ion or a fragment retaining the thienopyrimidine core with partial substitution. Lower-abundance peaks in the m/z 200–250 range suggest further fragmentation of the heterocyclic system, including possible loss of small neutral molecules like HCN or CS. Overall, the spectrum reflects the structural complexity of the molecule, with fragmentation patterns dominated by the stability of aromatic systems and the influence of chlorine isotopes.

The base peak at m/z 105 dominates the spectrum, indicating a highly stable fragment likely derived from the benzoyl moiety (C7H5O+), a common fragment in aromatic ketones due to resonance stabilization. Adjacent to this, the peak at m/z 77 corresponds to the phenyl cation (C6H5+), further supporting the presence of an aromatic ring. A significant peak at m/z 219 suggests a fragment retaining a substantial portion of the molecular framework, potentially arising from the loss of the tert-butyl group (C4H9, 57 Da) from the molecular ion, yielding a structure consistent with the remaining piperazine and carbonyl fragments. The peak at m/z 263 may represent the molecular ion minus a methyl group (CH3, 15 Da), though the absence of the full molecular ion (calculated m/z 318) implies extensive fragmentation, likely due to the instability of the Boc-protected piperazine structure under ionization. Additional peaks at m/z 133 and 176 correspond to fragments involving the Boc group (e.g., C5H9N2O2+ and C8H12N2O2+), while the peak at m/z 113 could arise from cleavage of the piperazine ring. The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the Boc-protected amine and aromatic ketone functionalities. The dominance of the benzoyl fragment (m/z 105) highlights the susceptibility of the carbonyl-adjacent bond to cleavage, while the retention of nitrogen-containing fragments (e.g., m/z 133, 176) underscores the role of the piperazine ring in stabilizing charged species. This spectrum exemplifies the characteristic behavior of Boc-protected amines in mass spectrometry, where labile protecting groups and heteroatom-rich frameworks drive distinct fragmentation pathways."

A triplet at ~4.2 ppm (integration ~2H) and a quartet at ~1.3 ppm (integration ~3H) are consistent with the ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3), showing the expected coupling pattern. The aromatic region (7.2–7.4 ppm) exhibits multiplets with integration ~5H, confirming the presence of a monosubstituted benzene ring. A broad singlet at ~1.4 ppm (integration ~9H) arises from the tert-butyl group of the carbamate protecting group. Additional multiplets in the aliphatic region (1.5–3.5 ppm) correspond to the cyclohexane ring protons and the methylene groups adjacent to nitrogen atoms. The chemical shifts and splitting patterns align with the expected electron-withdrawing effects of the carbonyl and aromatic groups, while the absence of unexpected peaks suggests high purity of the sample. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the molecule’s structural integrity, including stereochemical elements implied by the splitting patterns of the cyclohexane ring protons."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C9H7F4NOS (SMILES: OCc1cc(F)cc2c1NC(C(F)(F)F)S2). The spectrum displays five prominent peaks in the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, corresponding to distinct carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak at approximately 150 ppm arises from the aromatic carbon directly bonded to the fluorine atom, as electronegative substituents like fluorine deshield adjacent carbons, shifting their signals to higher ppm values. A peak near 120 ppm is attributed to the carbon bearing the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group in the thiazole ring, where the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the three fluorine atoms significantly deshields this carbon. Another aromatic carbon, likely positioned ortho to the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) group, resonates at ~110 ppm, reflecting moderate deshielding from the adjacent oxygen atom. The peak at ~60 ppm corresponds to the CH2OH methylene carbon, which is strongly deshielded by the electronegative oxygen atom. Finally, the upfield peak at ~30 ppm is assigned to the thiazole ring carbon adjacent to sulfur, as sulfur’s lower electronegativity compared to oxygen results in less deshielding. The absence of additional peaks suggests overlap or symmetry in some aromatic carbons, consistent with the fused benzene-thiazole structure. The CF3 group’s carbon does not exhibit splitting in this spectrum, likely due to proton decoupling or rapid relaxation processes. Overall, the chemical shifts align with the expected electronic effects of substituents in this heterocyclic system."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C8H15NO2 (SMILES: O=C(O)CCC1CCNC1). The spectrum displays several distinct features characteristic of a molecule containing a piperidine ring and a propanoic acid side chain. The most prominent peak appears at approximately 3.5 ppm, which corresponds to the methylene protons (CH2) adjacent to the nitrogen atom in the piperidine ring. These protons are deshielded due to the electronegative nitrogen, resulting in their downfield chemical shift. Additional peaks between 2.5–3.0 ppm likely represent the ring protons in the piperidine moiety, particularly those near the nitrogen, while the broader multiplets in the 1.5–2.5 ppm range correspond to the remaining methylene groups in both the piperidine ring and the propanoic acid side chain. The absence of a distinct peak near 10–12 ppm suggests that the carboxylic acid proton (O-H) is either broadened beyond detection due to rapid exchange with solvent or not fully resolved in this spectrum. The integration of the peaks aligns with the expected proton count: the piperidine ring contributes multiple overlapping signals from its six-membered structure, while the propyl linker (CCC) generates peaks consistent with three methylene groups. The splitting patterns and coupling constants further indicate spin-spin interactions between adjacent protons, typical of aliphatic systems. Overall, the spectral data confirm the presence of a piperidine ring and a propanoic acid substituent, consistent with the provided molecular formula and SMILES notation."

A broad, intense peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of O-H stretching vibrations, likely from the hydroxyl group (C-OH) in the structure. Adjacent to this, a sharp peak around 3400 cm⁻¹ may correspond to N-H stretching from the primary amine group (-NH₂). The sharp peaks in the 2900–2800 cm⁻¹ region are attributed to C-H stretching vibrations in aliphatic chains, consistent with the long alkyl linker (CCCCCC) and aromatic substituents. Aromatic C-H stretching vibrations appear as weaker peaks near 3050–3100 cm⁻¹, aligning with the benzene and pyridine rings in the molecule. The prominent absorption near 1600 cm⁻¹ likely corresponds to C=C stretching in aromatic systems, while a weaker band around 1500 cm⁻¹ may indicate N-H bending or C-N stretching from the amine or tertiary amine (N-CH₂) groups. The sharp peak near 1250 cm⁻¹ is consistent with C-O stretching in the ether linkage (C-O-C) from the ethoxy group. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex, overlapping peaks, including possible C-Cl stretching vibrations near 600–800 cm⁻¹, which are typical for chlorinated aromatic compounds.

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (Cl and N#C) deshields adjacent protons, shifting their signals downfield. The splitting pattern suggests a complex coupling arrangement, likely due to the meta and para substitution pattern of the nitrile, chlorine, and ether-linked side chain. A prominent peak near 7.8 ppm may arise from protons ortho to the nitrile group, while signals at 7.5–7.2 ppm and 6.8 ppm likely correspond to remaining aromatic protons influenced by the chlorine and ether substituents. A singlet or multiplet near 4.2 ppm indicates the methylene group (OCH2) adjacent to the oxygen atom, which is deshielded by the electronegative oxygen.

The spectrum displays characteristic features consistent with the structural motifs of this compound. The most prominent signal is a sharp singlet at approximately 2 ppm, which dominates the aliphatic region. This peak likely corresponds to the nine equivalent protons of the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) from the Boc protecting group, a common moiety in organic synthesis. The high symmetry of this group typically results in a single, intense resonance. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), several smaller peaks are observed. These signals arise from the protons on the phenyl ring (c3ccc(O)cc3) and the heteroaromatic pyrimidone core (n1c(=O)[nH]c2ncc(-c3ccc(O)cc3)nc21). The phenyl ring protons, positioned para to the hydroxyl group, are expected to exhibit two doublets (each integrating to 2H) due to the symmetry of the substituted benzene. The heteroaromatic protons on the pyrimidone ring (positions 5 and 7) may appear as distinct signals in this region, though their exact chemical shifts depend on the electronic environment created by the adjacent carbonyl and nitrogen atoms. A notable signal at ~10 ppm is observed, which is characteristic of an exchangeable proton, such as the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the phenol or the NH proton of the pyrimidone ring. This peak’s downfield position reflects strong hydrogen bonding or deshielding effects. Additionally, the pyrrolidine ring (N1CCCC1) contributes to the aliphatic region, with its methylene protons (CH2) appearing as multiplets between 1.5–3.5 ppm, depending on their proximity to the nitrogen atom. The absence of signals below 0 ppm or above 12 ppm confirms the lack of highly acidic protons (e.g., carboxylic acids) or strongly deshielded environments. The overall peak distribution aligns with the molecular structure, where the Boc group, pyrrolidine, pyrimidone, and phenyl moieties each contribute distinct spectral features. Integration and splitting patterns (not explicitly shown here) would further validate proton counts and coupling relationships, but the observed chemical shifts provide a clear fingerprint of this compound’s H-NMR profile."

Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (100–160 ppm):** - A prominent peak near **150 ppm** likely arises from aromatic carbons adjacent to electronegative substituents. In the SMILES structure, the aromatic ring with two chlorine atoms (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl) contains carbons ortho to the oxygen atom, which are strongly deshielded by the electron-withdrawing Cl and OCH2 groups. - Peaks between **120–140 ppm** correspond to other aromatic carbons in both rings.

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of hydrogen atoms in the molecule. The most downfield peak, observed near 13.5 ppm, corresponds to the exchangeable proton of the imide NH group in the barbiturate-like ring system (C3(C(=O)NC(=O)NC3=O)). This high chemical shift is characteristic of deshielded protons in hydrogen-bonded environments, typical of cyclic amides. A second NH proton appears as a sharp peak at ~10.5 ppm, likely from the adjacent amide group, though its exact position may vary slightly due to solvent effects or hydrogen bonding. In the aromatic region (~7.5–8.5 ppm), a multiplet near 8.0 ppm arises from the protons on the benzene ring substituted with the nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]). The electron-withdrawing nitro group deshields these protons, shifting their signals downfield. The splitting pattern suggests coupling between the aromatic protons, consistent with a 1,2,4-substitution pattern on the ring. A peak at ~6.0 ppm corresponds to the methine proton (CH) adjacent to the oxygen in the morpholine-like ring ([C@@H]1O[C@@H](C)CN2...). This proton experiences moderate deshielding due to the electronegative oxygen atom. Two additional peaks at ~2.0 ppm and ~1.5 ppm are assigned to the methyl groups (CH3) attached to the morpholine ring. These appear as doublets due to coupling with the adjacent methine protons (J ~6–7 Hz), a hallmark of isopropyl-type splitting. The absence of signals below 2 ppm indicates no aliphatic CH2 or CH3 groups in non-coupled environments. The spectrum’s simplicity in the upfield region aligns with the molecule’s rigid bicyclic structure, which limits conformational flexibility and reduces peak overlap. Overall, the H-NMR data confirm the presence of aromatic, amide, and aliphatic protons in a highly functionalized framework, consistent with the proposed structure.

This base peak confirms the molecular identity and suggests high stability of the ion under the ionization conditions. Several key fragment ions are observed, providing insights into the structural features. A significant peak at m/z 145, with moderate relative abundance, likely arises from cleavage of the acetyl group (C2H3O, 43 Da) and part of the furan ring, leaving a triazole-containing fragment. The peak at m/z 123 may correspond to a triazole-derived ion (C4H5N4O, 125 Da) after further fragmentation, though its exact origin requires tandem MS analysis for confirmation. Smaller peaks at m/z 117 and 105 suggest losses of methyl (15 Da) and acetyl (43 Da) groups from intermediate fragments. In the higher m/z region, peaks at 227 and 229 (with a 2 Da spacing) likely represent isotopic contributions from a fragment containing a chlorine or bromine atom; however, the absence of these elements in the molecular formula suggests these peaks may instead arise from rearrangement ions or adducts.

Additional minor peaks (e.g., m/z 87, 91, 130) are likely due to further degradation of the furan or triazole rings. Overall, the fragmentation pattern reflects the structural complexity of the molecule, with cleavage occurring primarily at the acetyl, amide, and heterocyclic bonds.

The m/z 276 peak may correspond to a sodium adduct [M+Na]+, while m/z 263 could indicate a protonated molecular ion [M+H]+. The presence of multiple peaks between m/z 80–200 reflects extensive fragmentation of the Boc group and pyrrolidine ring, with notable peaks at 82 (likely a small hydrocarbon fragment), 95 (benzylic fragment), 107 (phenoxy-related ion), and 133/135 (halogen-like isotopic pair, though no halogens are present in the formula, suggesting a structural rearrangement). The azide group ([N-]=[N+]=[N-]) likely contributes to unique fragmentation pathways, as evidenced by the absence of a detectable molecular ion peak at m/z 334 (calculated for C16H22N4O3). Instead, the spectrum emphasizes stable cationic fragments derived from heterolytic bond cleavages. The phenoxy group (c1ccccc1) is consistent with peaks at m/z 95 and 107, which align with common aromatic ether fragmentation patterns. The observed peaks at 192/193 and 220/221 suggest secondary fragmentations involving the pyrrolidine core, potentially losing neutral fragments like H2O or CO. Overall, the spectrum reflects the compound’s structural complexity, with fragmentation dominated by the Boc group’s lability, azide-induced reactivity, and aromatic ether stability. These features align with the expected behavior of a Boc-protected azido-pyrrolidine derivative bearing a phenoxy substituent."

The spectrum displays several key features corresponding to the distinct proton environments in the molecule. A prominent singlet at 10.2 ppm is observed, which can be attributed to the hydroxyl (OH) proton of the hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). This proton appears downfield due to deshielding effects from hydrogen bonding and the electronegative oxygen atom. In the aromatic region, a series of peaks at 7.8, 7.0, and 6.8 ppm are present, corresponding to the single proton on the thiazole ring (position 5). The splitting into three peaks suggests possible coupling with adjacent protons, such as the methylene group (-CH2-) attached to the thiazole ring, though the exact splitting pattern may indicate complex coupling or solvent effects. The region between 4.0 and 4.2 ppm shows a multiplet, which integrates to the two protons of the hydroxymethyl methylene group (-CH2OH) and the four protons from the morpholine ring's oxygen-adjacent methylene groups (-CH2O-). These protons appear downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent oxygen atoms. Additionally, a peak at 3.5 ppm is observed, corresponding to the four protons of the morpholine ring's nitrogen-adjacent methylene groups (-CH2N-), which are slightly upfield compared to the oxygen-adjacent protons. The overall spectral features align with the expected proton environments in the provided molecular structure, confirming the presence of the thiazole core, hydroxymethyl substituent, and morpholine ring."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, consistent with the structural features of the compound. The most prominent peak appears near 180 ppm, indicative of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the urea moiety (CCNC(=O)N–). This high-field shift reflects the deshielding effect of the adjacent electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Additional peaks in the 130–160 ppm range correspond to aromatic carbons in the thiazole (s1) and pyridine (c2cnc(Cl)c(NS(C)(=O)=O)c2) rings. The chlorine substituent on the pyridine ring likely induces downfield shifts for neighboring carbons due to its electron-withdrawing nature. A cluster of signals between 100–130 ppm may arise from the thiazole ring carbons, including the methyl-substituted carbon (c(C)) and the carbon bonded to sulfur. The aliphatic region (0–50 ppm) shows peaks near 30 ppm and 10 ppm, assignable to the ethyl group (CCN) and the methyl group (c(C)) in the thiazole ring, respectively. The sulfonamide group (NS(C)(=O)=O) contributes to the carbon resonance near 40 ppm, reflecting the deshielding effect of the sulfonyl group. The absence of signals below 0 ppm or above 200 ppm confirms no spurious artifacts or impurities dominate the spectrum.

The aromatic region (110–150 ppm) exhibits multiple resonances, reflecting the two benzene rings and their substituents. The peak around 140 ppm likely arises from the ipso carbon of the tetrazole-substituted aromatic ring, influenced by the electron-withdrawing tetrazole group (n3cnnn3). Additional aromatic carbons appear between 120–135 ppm, with variations in chemical shift due to the electron-donating phenoxy group and the electron-deficient tetrazole moiety. The absence of signals below 50 ppm confirms no aliphatic carbons beyond the methylene group.

Key features include: 1. **Aliphatic region**: Cross-peaks at ~1.2 ppm (¹H) and ~25–30 ppm (¹³C) correspond to the central CH₂ groups of the hexyl chain. Their chemical shifts reflect a purely aliphatic environment. 2. **Heteroatom-adjacent carbons**: Peaks at ~3.5 ppm (¹H) and ~55–60 ppm (¹³C) arise from CH₂ groups bonded to oxygen (e.g., -CH₂OH) or nitrogen (e.g., -NCH₂-). These shifts are characteristic of deshielding by electronegative atoms. 3. **Symmetry**: The molecule’s symmetric structure results in duplicated cross-peaks for equivalent groups in the two ethylenediamine arms, though some overlap may occur due to similar chemical environments. 4. **Hydroxyl protons**: Broad ¹H signals near 4.5 ppm show weak or absent correlations, likely due to rapid exchange or hydrogen bonding, which suppresses HSQC intensity.

These peaks confirm the presence of the two electron-withdrawing ester moieties in the structure. In the alkene region (100–150 ppm), two prominent peaks around 130 ppm and 120 ppm correspond to the sp²-hybridized carbons of the conjugated double bonds. The higher-field alkene carbon (~120 ppm) is likely the terminal carbon of the propenoate group, while the lower-field signal (~130 ppm) corresponds to the central alkene carbon bonded to the dimethylamino and methyl substituents, which deshields it due to the electron-donating effects of the adjacent nitrogen. The methoxy groups (-OCH₃) of the esters produce signals near 55 ppm, consistent with their typical chemical shift range.

The overall fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule: a benzofuran core (m/z 121 base peak) substituted with a methoxybenzyl group, methyl, and propyl chains. The stability of the m/z 121 fragment implies resonance stabilization, likely from a tropylium-like ion formed via ring opening of the furan moiety.

    "text": "This is an IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C9H17NO3 (SMILES: C[C@@H](C=O)N(C)C(=O)OC(C)(C)C). The spectrum displays characteristic absorption features consistent with the functional groups present in this carbamate-containing aldehyde. A prominent sharp peak at ~1720 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the carbamate group, while a narrower band near 1740 cm⁻¹ suggests the aldehyde C=O stretch. The absence of broad O-H or N-H stretching bands between 3200–3600 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of hydroxyl or primary/secondary amine groups, consistent with the tertiary amine and protected carbamate structure. Multiple C-H stretching vibrations are evident in the 2800–3000 cm⁻¹ region, with peaks at ~2960 cm⁻¹ (asymmetric CH₃ stretch) and ~2870 cm⁻¹ (symmetric CH₃ stretch) from the tert-butyl group, as well as ~2930 cm⁻¹ (asymmetric CH₂ stretch) and ~2850 cm⁻¹ (symmetric CH₂ stretch) from the aliphatic backbone. The aldehyde C-H stretch appears as a weak, narrow band near 2720 cm⁻¹. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), a strong absorption at ~1250 cm⁻¹ corresponds to C-O stretching in the carbamate ester linkage, while peaks at ~1150 cm⁻¹ and ~1050 cm⁻¹ likely arise from C-N stretching and C-C skeletal vibrations. The spectral pattern between 1450–1470 cm⁻¹ reflects CH₂ bending modes, and the absence of significant absorption near 2200 cm⁻¹ confirms no nitrile or alkyne functionalities are present. These features collectively align with the structural motifs of the (S)-configured carbamate-protected aldehyde, with diagnostic peaks enabling identification of the carbonyl, aldehyde, and alkyl components. The spectrum provides clear evidence for the functional group integrity of this molecule without indicating impurities or unexpected structural deviations."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule’s structural complexity. Key features include: 1. **Carbonyl Carbon (≈170 ppm):** A prominent peak near 170 ppm corresponds to the amide carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the dimethylcarbamoyl group. This downfield shift is characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons deshielded by the electronegative oxygen. 2. **Aromatic Region (120–140 ppm):** Multiple peaks in this range arise from the six aromatic carbons of the phenyl ring (c2ccccc2). The splitting pattern suggests a monosubstituted benzene derivative, with meta/para carbons appearing at slightly lower shifts (≈125–130 ppm) and ortho carbons (closer to the substituent) shifted downfield (≈135–140 ppm) due to inductive effects. 3. **Aliphatic and Heterocyclic Carbons (20–60 ppm):** - A sharp peak near 60 ppm likely corresponds to the quaternary carbon (C1) in the piperidine ring (C2 in the SMILES notation), adjacent to the amide nitrogen. This deshielding effect is typical for carbons bonded to electronegative atoms. - Peaks between 40–55 ppm are attributed to methylene (CH₂) groups in the piperidine ring (C3, C4, C5) and the ethylene linker (CH₂N in the dimethylcarbamoyl group). These shifts reflect their proximity to nitrogen atoms, which induce downfield displacement. - The dimethyl groups of the carbamoyl moiety (N(CH₃)₂) appear as a singlet near 35 ppm, consistent with their sp³-hybridized, shielded environment. 4. **Quaternary Carbon (≈50 ppm):** A distinct resonance near 50 ppm may correspond to the sp³-hybridized carbon (C6 in the piperidine ring) bearing the phenyl substituent. Its shift reflects both the steric bulk of the phenyl group and its connection to the ring nitrogen. The spectrum’s resolution and peak distribution align with the molecular symmetry and functional group diversity of the compound. Notably, the absence of peaks above 200 ppm confirms the lack of aldehyde/ketone carbonyls, while the aromatic and aliphatic regions collectively validate the presence of the phenyl and piperidine substructures. Integration of these features provides a comprehensive overview of the molecule’s carbon framework, consistent with the proposed structure."

The spectrum exhibits several key features corresponding to the functional groups in the structure. A series of sharp peaks in the 3000–3100 cm⁻¹ region indicate aromatic C-H stretching vibrations from the benzene rings, consistent with the conjugated aromatic system. The prominent absorption near 1600 cm⁻¹ corresponds to C=C stretching in the aromatic rings and the conjugated alkene (/C=C/), while a weaker band around 1500 cm⁻¹ may arise from C=N stretching in the benzoxazole heterocycle. A strong, broad peak at ~1200 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of C-O stretching in the ether linkage (OCCCCl), and a distinct peak near 800 cm⁻¹ aligns with C-Cl stretching vibrations. The absence of broad absorptions in the 3300–3500 cm⁻¹ region confirms the lack of O-H or N-H groups, consistent with the molecular structure. Additional fine peaks in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) reflect complex vibrational modes of the fused-ring system and substituent groups. These spectral features collectively validate the presence of aromaticity, ether, alkene, and halogenated alkyl moieties in the compound."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating ¹H and ¹³C chemical shifts, providing insights into the molecule’s structural features. The aliphatic region (0–3 ppm in ¹H, 0–60 ppm in ¹³C) shows multiple resolved peaks, consistent with the presence of ethyl (CCC), tert-butyl (C(CH₃)₃), and methyl (CH₃) groups. Notably, the tert-butyl group attached to the sulfoxide moiety (S=O) likely contributes a cluster of peaks near 1.3 ppm (¹H) and 25 ppm (¹³C), reflecting its equivalent methyl environments. The ethyl groups in the central carbon (CCC(CC)) exhibit correlations in the 0.9–1.6 ppm (¹H) and 10–30 ppm (¹³C) ranges, with methylene (CH₂) and methyl (CH₃) resonances distinguishable by their chemical shifts. In the aromatic region (6.5–8 ppm in ¹H, 120–140 ppm in ¹³C), cross-peaks correspond to the two substituted benzene rings. The protons on the aromatic rings (c1ccc(...)c1) appear as distinct signals between 6.8–7.5 ppm, with attached carbons resonating between 125–140 ppm. The methyl substituents on the aromatic rings (c(C)c1) are evident as correlations near 2.3 ppm (¹H) and 20 ppm (¹³C). Additionally, the methylene group adjacent to the sulfoxide (CCS(=O)) may exhibit shifted peaks due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the S=O group, likely appearing downfield in the ¹H spectrum (2.5–3.0 ppm) and at higher ¹³C shifts (40–50 ppm). The oxygenated aliphatic region (3.5–4.5 ppm in ¹H, 60–80 ppm in ¹³C) contains correlations from the OC[C@@H](O)CH₂OH moiety. The CH₂ groups adjacent to oxygen (e.g., OCH₂) are expected in the 3.6–4.0 ppm (¹H) and 65–75 ppm (¹³C) range, while the hydroxyl-bearing carbons may appear slightly downfield. The spectrum’s sparsity in the carbonyl region (<170 ppm in ¹³C) confirms the absence of ketone or ester groups, aligning with the molecular formula. Overall, the HSQC spectrum effectively maps the molecule’s carbon-proton connectivity, validating the structural features of the sulfoxide, aromatic rings, and aliphatic chains described in the SMILES notation."

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups present in the molecule. A broad, intense peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of N-H stretching vibrations, likely from the amide (C(N)=O) and urea (NC(N)=O) groups, as well as potential contributions from the carboxylic acid (C(=O)O) O-H stretch. A sharp, strong absorption at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the C=O stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group, while a slightly lower-frequency peak near 1650 cm⁻¹ may correspond to the amide carbonyl stretching. Additional peaks in the 1500–1600 cm⁻¹ region are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching from the phenyl and thiophene rings. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) displays multiple sharp peaks, including a prominent band near 1200 cm⁻¹ attributed to C-O stretching of the carboxylic acid and possible C-N stretching from the amine or amide groups. Weaker absorptions near 1100–1000 cm⁻¹ may arise from C-S stretching in the thiophene moiety.

In the region between 3100–3000 cm⁻¹, multiple sharp peaks are observed, corresponding to aromatic C–H stretching vibrations from the substituted benzene ring. The absence of broad O–H or N–H stretches indicates no hydroxyl or amine groups are present. A prominent peak near 2900 cm⁻¹ is attributed to aliphatic C–H stretching from the isopropyl group (–CH(CH₃)₂). Between 1600–1500 cm⁻¹, a series of medium-intensity peaks arise from C=C stretching in the aromatic ring and potentially C=N stretching from the thiazole moiety (c2nc(Br)ns2). The strong absorption near 1200 cm⁻¹ is consistent with C–O stretching vibrations from the ether linkage (–O–CH(CH₃)₂). Additionally, a distinct peak around 1000 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C–S stretching, a feature common in sulfur-containing heterocycles like thiazoles. In the fingerprint region (below 1000 cm⁻¹), multiple sharp peaks are evident, including those near 800 cm⁻¹ and 600 cm⁻¹, which likely originate from C–Cl and C–Br stretching vibrations, respectively. These halogenated bonds exhibit lower wavenumber absorptions due to their heavier atomic masses. The overall spectral pattern reflects the molecule’s aromaticity, ether functionality, and halogen substitution, with no evidence of carbonyl (C=O) or nitro (NO₂) groups.

The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at m/z 380, corresponding to the intact molecule. A prominent peak at m/z 362 represents a loss of 18 Da (H₂O), suggesting dehydration, likely from the amide or morpholine moiety. The base peak at m/z 293 indicates the most stable fragment, formed by cleavage of the amide bond, resulting in the loss of the morpholine-containing fragment (C₄H₈NO, 87 Da). Additional fragments at m/z 173 and 174 arise from further decomposition of the benzoyl group (C₇H₃Cl₂O⁺), with the isotopic pattern of chlorine (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl) contributing to the relative intensities of these peaks. The peak at m/z 92 corresponds to a pyridine-derived fragment (C₅H₄N⁺), consistent with the pyridyl substituent in the SMILES structure.

The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at m/z 341, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the intact molecule. The presence of bromine and chlorine isotopes is evident in the characteristic isotope patterns: peaks at m/z 341 (M⁺) and 343 (M⁺+2) exhibit a 1:1 ratio due to the ⁷⁹Br/⁸¹Br isotopes, while peaks at m/z 162 and 163 (base peak) show a similar pattern, confirming bromine incorporation.

The spectrum lacks signals for quaternary carbons (e.g., carbonyl carbon at ~165 ppm or sulfonamide sulfur-attached carbons), as HSQC only detects protonated carbons. The observed correlations align with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of aromatic, vinylic, methoxy, and N-methyl functionalities. This analysis provides direct evidence for the connectivity and functional groups described in the given SMILES notation."

The spectrum exhibits several key features consistent with the structural motifs in this compound. A prominent sharp peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to aromatic C-H stretching vibrations, typical of the benzene ring in the molecule. Adjacent weaker peaks around 2900 cm⁻¹ arise from aliphatic C-H stretches in the methyl (CH₃) and methylene (CH₂) groups of the ethyl ester and propargyl substituents. The most intense absorption at ~1750 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of the ester carbonyl (C=O) stretch, confirming the presence of the -COOEt functional group. A distinct band near 2100 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a C≡C triple bond, consistent with the internal alkyne in the propargyl moiety. This peak’s moderate intensity aligns with the asymmetric nature of the alkyne, which allows for IR activity. The strong, broad absorption at ~1200 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the sulfonate ester (OSO₂CF₃) group, specifically the S=O asymmetric stretching vibrations. Additional peaks in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) correspond to C-O stretches (e.g., ester and sulfonate linkages) and aromatic C=C skeletal vibrations. The absence of broad O-H or N-H stretches confirms the lack of hydroxyl or amine groups in the structure. Overall, the spectral features correlate well with the functional groups in the provided molecular formula and SMILES notation."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between proton (1H) and carbon (13C) chemical shifts for covalently bonded atom pairs. The spectrum exhibits distinct cross-peaks corresponding to specific structural motifs in the molecule. In the aromatic region (1H: 6.5–8 ppm, 13C: 110–160 ppm), multiple cross-peaks are observed, reflecting the two benzene rings in the structure. The protons on the substituted phenyl rings (c1ccc(C#Cc2ccccc2C)cc1) appear as a cluster of peaks between 7.0–7.5 ppm, correlating with their attached aromatic carbons. The alkyne linkage (C#C) does not contribute directly to the HSQC spectrum, as it lacks attached protons. A prominent cross-peak at ~4.1 ppm (1H) and ~65 ppm (13C) corresponds to the OCH2 group in the ethyl ester moiety (CCOC(=O)CO–), where the methylene protons are deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom. Another set of peaks near ~4.4 ppm (1H) and ~70 ppm (13C) likely arises from the methylene group (–OCH2–) connecting the ester to the aromatic ring. The methyl group (–C#Cc2ccccc2C) generates a cross-peak at ~2.3 ppm (1H) and ~21 ppm (13C), consistent with a typical aromatic methyl substituent. The absence of peaks in the carbonyl region (13C: 160–180 ppm) confirms that the ester carbonyl carbon (C=O) lacks directly attached protons, as expected. Overall, the HSQC spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, validating the connectivity of protons to their respective carbons in the aromatic, aliphatic, and ester regions. The data supports the molecular formula and SMILES notation provided, offering insights into the electronic environment of individual atoms within the molecule."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecular structure. Key features include a prominent peak near 150 ppm, corresponding to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the lactam ring, which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen. Adjacent to this, a cluster of peaks between 120–140 ppm arises from aromatic carbons in the benzene ring and the brominated pyrrole-like ring. The bromine substituent (Br) induces significant downfield shifts for nearby carbons, particularly evident in the resonance near 100–120 ppm, where the carbon directly bonded to bromine appears. Two methoxy groups (-OCH3) contribute to the intense signals around 50–60 ppm, consistent with their electron-donating effects and typical chemical shift range for alkoxy carbons. The aliphatic region (0–50 ppm) shows peaks near 40–50 ppm, likely from the methylene carbons (-CH2-) in the piperazine-like ring system. The splitting of peaks in this region suggests non-equivalent environments for these carbons due to the molecule’s asymmetry. The spectrum’s overall pattern aligns with the proposed structure, where the lactam ring, aromatic systems, and methoxy groups generate distinct chemical environments. The absence of peaks above 160 ppm confirms no additional carbonyl or highly unsaturated carbons beyond the lactam. Integration of peak intensities further supports the presence of 16 unique carbons, consistent with the molecular formula. This C-NMR data effectively corroborates the structural features encoded in the SMILES notation, including the bromine’s influence on neighboring carbons and the electronic effects of oxygen-containing substituents."

The spectrum displays four distinct cross-peaks, each corresponding to direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei in the molecule. The most downfield peak at approximately 10 ppm (¹H) and 160 ppm (¹³C) likely arises from a deshielded aromatic proton and its attached carbon, possibly within the pyridazine ring (nn1) adjacent to the amino group (-N), as electron-withdrawing substituents elevate both shifts. A second peak at ~8 ppm (¹H) and 50 ppm (¹³C) suggests a methylene group (CH₂) in an electron-deficient environment, such as the CH₂O moiety connecting the isoxazole and pyridazine rings, where oxygen deshields the protons and carbon. The cross-peak at ~7 ppm (¹H) and 130 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to aromatic CH groups in the phenyl ring (c2ccccc2) or pyridazine ring, reflecting typical sp²-hybridized carbons and protons in conjugated systems. Finally, the upfield peak at ~4 ppm (¹H) and 60 ppm (¹³C) is consistent with a methyl group (CH₃) attached to oxygen (O-CH₃) in the isoxazole ring, where the oxygen atom shifts the proton and carbon resonances downfield relative to a typical alkyl group. The absence of additional peaks indicates that quaternary carbons (e.g., the isoxazole nitrogen-adjacent carbon) and non-protonated carbons do not contribute to the HSQC spectrum. This analysis aligns with the proposed structure, confirming key functional groups and their connectivity through heteronuclear correlations."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks corresponding to the unique proton environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak at ~12.0 ppm is a singlet, likely attributed to the indole NH proton, which is strongly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding or aromatic ring current effects. A second singlet at ~10.0 ppm may correspond to the secondary amine (NH) linking the two aromatic rings, though its exact position could be influenced by solvent interactions. Aromatic protons dominate the region between 6.5–8.5 ppm, with multiple multiplets reflecting the complex splitting patterns of the substituted benzene rings. The indole moiety contributes peaks in this range, particularly the vinylic protons of the five-membered ring (~7.0–7.5 ppm), while the benzene ring adjacent to the ester and cyclopropyl group exhibits deshielded protons (~7.5–8.5 ppm) due to electron-withdrawing effects of the carbonyl group. The allyl ester group (C=CCO-) produces characteristic signals: a doublet at ~6.0 ppm for the vinyl CH proton, and two multiplets at ~4.5–5.0 ppm for the OCH2 group, split by coupling with the adjacent vinyl protons. The cyclopropyl group (C2CC2) appears as a singlet near ~1.0 ppm, indicating symmetry in its proton environment. Additional peaks at ~2.0–3.0 ppm may arise from residual solvent or minor impurities, as no aliphatic protons are present in the core structure beyond the cyclopropyl and allyl groups. The overall spectral pattern aligns with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of aromatic, heterocyclic, and unsaturated aliphatic components."

The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 510, corresponding to the intact molecule. A significant peak at m/z 478 (relative abundance ~80%) suggests a loss of 32 Da, likely due to cleavage of the methoxy group (OCH3, 31 Da) or a methanol molecule (CH3OH, 32 Da) from the ester functionality. The base peak at m/z 294 (100% relative abundance) indicates a highly stable fragment, possibly arising from the loss of both the ester side chain and a trifluoromethyl group (CF3, 69 Da) from the molecular ion. Additional major peaks at m/z 229, 199, and 168 correspond to sequential fragmentations involving the aromatic rings and heteroatoms. The peak at m/z 156 may represent a fragment retaining the chlorinated phenyl ring and thiazole moiety, while m/z 140 could correspond to a fluorinated benzene derivative. The presence of chlorine is evidenced by isotope peaks at m/z 296 and 231 (approximately 3:1 intensity ratios), consistent with the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl. Fluorine-rich fragments are supported by the prevalence of peaks at m/z 199 and 168, which may retain CF3 or CF2 groups. The spectrum's complexity reflects the molecule's multiple functional groups (ester, thioether, nitro, halogenated aromatics) and their propensity for diverse fragmentation pathways under electron ionization. The observed pattern aligns with the molecular structure, demonstrating characteristic losses of halogenated substituents and stable aromatic/heterocyclic fragments."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the unique carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at ~0 ppm arises from the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) of the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group, reflecting the high symmetry and aliphatic nature of these methyl carbons. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~20–30 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent carbons of the cyclopropyl ring (C1CC1), which typically resonate in this region due to their strained sp³ hybridization. A moderate-intensity peak at ~50 ppm is attributed to the methylene carbons (CH2) adjacent to the Boc carbonyl and the hydroxyl-bearing carbon (CH(OH)), which experience deshielding from electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The aromatic region (~100–150 ppm) shows two key features: a peak at ~100 ppm, likely from the quaternary carbon (C3a) in the indole ring system, and a sharper peak at ~150 ppm, assigned to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the Boc group. The latter’s high chemical shift reflects the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Additional minor peaks in the 20–40 ppm range may correspond to other aliphatic carbons in the indoline or cyclopropyl moieties. Notably, the absence of peaks above 170 ppm suggests no additional carbonyl groups (e.g., the indole’s amide carbonyl) are resolved in this spectrum, possibly due to overlap or low abundance. The overall pattern aligns with the expected chemical environments of the molecule, including the Boc-protected amine, hydroxyl group, indole core, and cyclopropyl substituent. This spectrum provides critical insights into the structural integrity and electronic environment of the carbons in this complex molecule."

The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 267, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 266 g/mol for C18H22N2. The base peak at m/z 267 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Notable fragment ions are observed at m/z 174, 175, 160, 158, 148, 145, 121, 120, 106, 105, 103, and 94, reflecting characteristic fragmentation pathways. The peak at m/z 174 (60% relative abundance) likely arises from cleavage of the tert-butyl group (C4H9, 57 Da) from the molecular ion, yielding a fragment retaining the aromatic and amine functionalities. The adjacent peak at m/z 175 may represent a related fragment with an additional hydrogen rearrangement. Peaks at m/z 160 and 158 (20–25% abundance) suggest further fragmentation of the heterocyclic ring system, possibly involving loss of a methyl group (15 Da) or hydrogen radical. The m/z 148 and 145 peaks could correspond to fragments retaining the phenylamine moiety (C6H7N, 109 Da) combined with portions of the aliphatic backbone. Lower-mass fragments, such as m/z 121, 120, 106, and 105, are consistent with aromatic ring-derived ions. For instance, m/z 105 (20% abundance) may represent a tropylium ion (C7H7+) from the toluene-like substituent, while m/z 106 could indicate a related amine-containing fragment. The peak at m/z 94 (10% abundance) aligns with a benzene ring bearing an amine group (C6H7N, 109 Da minus 15 Da for a methyl loss). The absence of significant peaks above m/z 267 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity, and the distribution of fragment ions reflects the molecule’s structural features, including the tert-butyl group, aromatic rings, and secondary amine. These observations are consistent with the proposed structure, where the indole-like core (from the SMILES notation) undergoes predictable cleavages under mass spectrometric conditions. The spectrum provides robust evidence for the assigned molecular formula and connectivity."

In the aromatic region, a dense grouping of peaks is observed between 6.5–8.0 ppm (1H) and 100–160 ppm (13C), consistent with the benzothiazole and benzyl subunits. These correlations correspond to the conjugated π-systems of the indole-like heterocycle (c2[nH]c3ccccc3c2) and the terminal phenyl ring (c1ccccc1). A prominent peak near 7.2 ppm (1H) and 128 ppm (13C) likely represents the benzyl methylene protons (SCCH2) and their directly bonded carbon. In the aliphatic region, a cluster of peaks at 2.5–3.5 ppm (1H) and 40–60 ppm (13C) reflects the hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) and adjacent carbons in the tetrahydroquinoline-like ring system. The downfield shift of the hydroxymethyl carbon (~60 ppm) aligns with its proximity to electronegative nitrogen and sulfur atoms. A distinct cross-peak at ~1.2 ppm (1H) and ~15 ppm (13C) corresponds to the methyl group (C[C@H]) at the stereogenic center.

The spectrum displays characteristic absorption features corresponding to the functional groups present in this quinoxaline-derived compound. A broad, medium-intensity band near 3300 cm⁻¹ likely arises from N-H stretching vibrations, though the molecule’s tertiary amine suggests this may instead correspond to C-H stretching in aromatic or aliphatic regions. Sharp, strong absorptions near 2950 cm⁻¹ are attributed to asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching in methyl groups (e.g., from the N-methyl and methoxy substituents). The prominent peak at ~1750 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of the methyl ester group, a hallmark of ester functionalities. In the fingerprint region (1500–500 cm⁻¹), multiple distinct peaks reflect complex vibrational modes. The strong absorption near 1300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to S=O stretching in the triflate (OSO₂CF₃) group, while the peak at ~1150 cm⁻¹ aligns with C-O stretching in the ester or sulfonate moieties.

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C13H14O3 (SMILES: O=C1CCCc2c(OCC3CO3)cccc21). The spectrum exhibits several key features characteristic of this structure. The base peak at m/z 145 dominates the spectrum, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. This peak likely arises from the loss of the epoxide-containing side chain (OCH2CH(O)CH2, calculated mass ~73) from the molecular ion (m/z 218, not observed here), leaving a tetralone-derived fragment (C10H9O+, m/z 145). The aromatic ketone core (tetralone) is a common source of stable fragments in mass spectrometry due to resonance stabilization. Adjacent to the base peak, minor peaks at m/z 146, 147, and 148 correspond to isotopic contributions from 13C and 18O, consistent with the fragment’s carbon and oxygen content. A prominent peak at m/z 163 suggests a secondary fragmentation pathway, possibly involving partial retention of the epoxide moiety or rearrangement. Additional peaks at m/z 91 (tropylium ion) and 103 confirm the presence of aromatic and oxygenated fragments, respectively.

Smaller peaks at m/z 105, 117, and 119 may correspond to further degradation of the tetralone ring or side-chain fragments, such as cleavage of the cyclohexanone ring or loss of CO (28 Da) from larger intermediates. The absence of the molecular ion (m/z 218) suggests it is either unstable under the ionization conditions or obscured by baseline noise. Overall, the fragmentation pattern reflects the molecule’s structural motifs: the epoxide side chain undergoes facile cleavage, while the aromatic ketone core generates stable, diagnostic ions. This spectrum exemplifies typical behavior of oxygenated aromatic compounds in mass spectrometry, with fragmentation driven by both inductive effects and resonance stabilization."

The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances consistent with the structural features of the compound. Key observations include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6.5–8.0 ppm):** Multiple sharp peaks are observed between 6.8–7.5 ppm, corresponding to the aromatic protons of the two benzene rings. The substituents (hydroxyl, methyl, and propylguanidine groups) create distinct chemical environments, leading to splitting patterns typical of substituted aromatics. The integration suggests four to six aromatic protons, aligning with the two rings in the structure. 2. **Glucose Moiety (3.0–5.5 ppm):** A cluster of peaks between 3.2–5.2 ppm arises from the protons on the glucopyranose ring. The anomeric proton (H-1 of the glucose) appears as a doublet near 4.5 ppm (J ≈ 7–8 Hz), indicating β-configuration. Additional multiplets in this region correspond to the remaining glucose protons (H-2 to H-6), with coupling patterns reflecting the ring’s stereochemistry. 3. **Methyl Group (2.0–2.5 ppm):** A singlet near 2.2 ppm is attributed to the methyl group attached to the aromatic ring (C-CH3), consistent with its deshielded environment. 4. **Aliphatic Chain (1.5–3.0 ppm):** Peaks in this range correspond to the propyl linker (CH2-CH2-CH2) between the aromatic ring and the guanidine group. The CH2 groups adjacent to the aromatic ring and the amine exhibit slightly higher chemical shifts (2.5–3.0 ppm), while the central CH2 appears downfield (1.8–2.2 ppm). 5. **Exchangeable Protons (broad peaks):** Broad resonances near 5.0–6.0 ppm may correspond to hydroxyl (OH) or guanidinium (NH) protons, though these are often poorly resolved in H-NMR due to rapid exchange with solvent. The spectrum’s intensity distribution reflects the relative number of protons in each environment, with the aromatic and glucose regions showing the highest intensities. The absence of peaks below 2 ppm suggests no long-chain alkyl groups or additional methyl substituents. Overall, the chemical shifts and splitting patterns align with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of aromatic, carbohydrate, and aliphatic domains."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C15H16N4O (SMILES: COc1cc(Cc2c[nH]c3ncc(C)cc23)cnc1N). The spectrum displays six distinct proton resonances across the chemical shift range of 14 to 4 ppm. The most downfield signal appears at 13.5 ppm as a sharp singlet, likely corresponding to the exchangeable N-H proton of the pyrrole ring (nH in the SMILES notation), which is strongly deshielded due to aromaticity and hydrogen bonding effects. A smaller singlet at 12.5 ppm may represent the primary amine proton (N-H) attached to the pyridine ring, though its reduced intensity suggests partial exchange with the solvent or rapid relaxation. At 10.5 ppm, a weak singlet is observed, potentially assignable to the methoxy group's adjacent aromatic proton (H-6 in the pyridine ring), influenced by the electron-withdrawing amino substituent. The most intense peak in the spectrum occurs at 8.5 ppm as a singlet, corresponding to the aromatic proton at position 4 of the pyrrole ring (H-4), which experiences strong deshielding from the adjacent nitrogen and conjugated system. Two additional aromatic protons appear at 6.5 ppm (doublet, J = 8.2 Hz) and 4.5 ppm (singlet). The doublet at 6.5 ppm likely arises from the H-5 proton on the pyridine ring, coupled to H-6, while the singlet at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene group (CH2) bridging the pyridine and pyrrole rings, which is deshielded by its proximity to both aromatic systems. The absence of signals below 4 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic protons beyond the methylene group. The integration ratios (inferred from relative intensities) align with the molecular structure: 1H (13.5 ppm), 1H (12.5 ppm), 1H (10.5 ppm), 1H (8.5 ppm), 1H (6.5 ppm), and 2H (4.5 ppm), totaling seven protons. The remaining nine protons (from C15H16N4O) are likely obscured by solvent signals or exhibit rapid exchange (e.g., NH2 group). This spectrum provides clear evidence of the compound's aromatic heterocyclic framework, methoxy substitution, and the connectivity between the pyridine and pyrrole moieties."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between proton (1H) and carbon (13C) nuclei, enabling the identification of covalently bonded 1H-13C pairs. The observed spectral features are consistent with the aromatic and heterocyclic components of the molecule. Key observations include: 1. **Aromatic Region (7–8 ppm, 120–140 ppm):** A cluster of peaks in this region corresponds to the aromatic protons and carbons of the benzene rings (e.g., the chlorinated phenyl ring and the indole moiety). The indole’s C2-H and C3-H protons typically resonate in this range, with their attached carbons appearing at ~120–130 ppm. The chlorinated phenyl ring’s protons and carbons also contribute to this region, with the electron-withdrawing Cl group slightly deshielding adjacent nuclei. 2. **Carbonyl-Adjacent Protons (~8–9 ppm, ~130–140 ppm):** A distinct peak near 8.5 ppm (1H) and 135 ppm (13C) likely arises from the proton on the indole’s C3 position, which is adjacent to the ketone (C=O) group. The carbonyl carbon itself is not directly observed in HSQC (as it lacks directly attached protons), but its influence on neighboring protons is evident. 3. **Sulfonamide Proton (~10–12 ppm, ~130–150 ppm):** A broad peak at ~11 ppm (1H) and ~140 ppm (13C) suggests the presence of the sulfonamide (N-H) proton and its attached sulfur-bound carbon. The deshielded 1H shift reflects hydrogen bonding or acidic character, while the 13C shift aligns with sp2-hybridized carbons near electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., SO2). 4. **Indole NH Proton (~7–9 ppm, ~100–120 ppm):** A weaker correlation in this range may correspond to the indole’s N-H proton and its attached carbon (C2), though this region often exhibits lower intensity due to rapid exchange or relaxation effects. The spectrum lacks signals in the aliphatic region (<5 ppm for 1H, <60 ppm for 13C), confirming the absence of saturated carbons. The observed correlations align with the molecule’s aromatic and heterocyclic framework, providing critical insights into its structural connectivity. The HSQC data, combined with the molecular formula and SMILES, support the identification of key functional groups, including the chlorinated aryl ring, indole core, ketone, and sulfonamide moiety."

The spectrum displays several key peaks that provide insights into the molecular structure and fragmentation behavior. The most prominent peak appears at m/z 460, which corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, confirming the molecular weight of 459.4 g/mol calculated from the given formula. This base peak (100% relative abundance) indicates high stability of the intact molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 373, 350, 306, and 263. The peak at m/z 373 (28% relative abundance) likely arises from the loss of a morpholine-containing fragment (C4H8NO, 87 Da) from the molecular ion, consistent with cleavage of the N-C bond linking the morpholine ring (N3CCOCC3) to the purine core. The peak at m/z 350 (86% relative abundance) suggests a further fragmentation step, potentially involving the loss of a chlorinated phenyl group (C6H4Cl, 113 Da) from the m/z 460 ion, leaving a dichlorinated purine derivative. The peak at m/z 306 (32% relative abundance) may correspond to a fragment retaining the dichlorophenyl group but losing both the morpholine and cyclohexylmethyl substituents (C10H17, 137 Da). Finally, the peak at m/z 263 (20% relative abundance) could represent a smaller fragment, such as a dichlorinated purine base (C9H5Cl2N5, 261 Da), with minor shifts due to isotopic contributions or residual substituents. The presence of chlorine atoms is corroborated by the characteristic isotope patterns observed in the spectrum. For example, the molecular ion peak at m/z 460 exhibits a minor satellite peak at m/z 462, consistent with the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes (approximately 3:1 ratio). Similar isotope signatures are faintly visible for other fragment ions, supporting the assigned fragmentation pathways. These spectral features align with the structural complexity of the molecule, which includes a purine core (nc3nc(Cl)nc(-c4cccc(Cl)c4)c32), a morpholine substituent (N3CCOCC3), and a chiral cyclohexylmethyl group ([C@@H]1CC[C@@H](Cn2...)CC1). The observed fragmentation pattern reflects the stability of the purine heterocycle and the susceptibility of N-alkyl and N-aryl bonds to cleavage under mass spectrometric conditions. This analysis demonstrates the utility of mass spectrometry in confirming molecular identity and elucidating structural motifs in complex organic molecules."

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups present in the molecule. A broad, moderately intense peak centered near 3300 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the O-H stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group (-COH) in the molecule. Sharp, intense peaks around 2900 cm⁻¹ correspond to C-H stretching vibrations from aliphatic CH₂ and CH₃ groups, including those in the isopropyl moiety and cyclohexane ring. A prominent peak near 1600 cm⁻¹ is consistent with C=N stretching in the pyridine ring, while weaker peaks in the 1500–1400 cm⁻¹ region may arise from aromatic C=C stretching and C-F stretching vibrations due to the fluorine substituents. The strong absorption near 1200 cm⁻¹ is indicative of C-O stretching in the alcohol group, and a distinct peak at ~1050 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C-N stretching in the secondary amine (-NH-CH₂-). Additional sharp peaks below 900 cm⁻¹, particularly near 800 cm⁻¹, are likely due to out-of-plane C-H bending vibrations in the aromatic pyridine ring and CF₃ group deformations. The absence of carbonyl (C=O) stretching bands confirms the lack of ketone or ester functionalities in the structure. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains complex, overlapping absorptions from multiple vibrational modes, including ring deformations and C-F/C-N coupled vibrations, which are consistent with the molecule’s fluorinated and heterocyclic components.

The spectrum displays correlations between proton (1H) and carbon (13C) nuclei, revealing key structural features of the molecule. The x-axis (1H) spans 14 to -2 ppm, while the y-axis (13C) ranges from 0 to 200 ppm. Distinct cross-peaks are observed in three primary regions: 1. **Aromatic Region (1H: 6–8 ppm; 13C: 100–160 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this area correspond to the two aromatic rings in the benzothiazine and phenyl groups. The 13C shifts between 110–140 ppm indicate protonated aromatic carbons, while peaks near 150 ppm may reflect carbons adjacent to electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., the sulfonyl group or nitrogen). The 1H shifts at 6.5–7.5 ppm align with aromatic protons, with slight upfield/downfield shifts due to substituents like the isopropoxy group (OCH(CH3)2) and sulfonamide (N(CH3)2). 2. **Aliphatic Region (1H: 0.5–3 ppm; 13C: 10–60 ppm):** This region shows correlations for aliphatic and heteroatom-bound carbons. The 13C shifts at 15–25 ppm correspond to methyl groups (e.g., the isopropyl methyls at ~1.2 ppm in 1H and ~22 ppm in 13C). Peaks near 40–50 ppm in 13C (1H ~2.5–3.5 ppm) are consistent with methylene groups (CH2) adjacent to nitrogen (N-CH2-CH2-CH2-Cl) and the sulfonamide methyls (N(CH3)2). The CH2Cl group appears at ~3.5 ppm (1H) and ~45 ppm (13C), reflecting deshielding by chlorine. 3. **Heteroatom-Substituted Carbons (13C: 50–100 ppm):** A cross-peak near 70 ppm (13C) and 4.5 ppm (1H) likely corresponds to the methine carbon (CH) of the isopropoxy group (O-CH(CH3)2), deshielded by oxygen. Peaks at ~50 ppm (13C) and ~3 ppm (1H) may arise from the N-CH2- group in the propyl chain. The spectrum lacks peaks above 160 ppm in 13C, confirming the absence of carbonyl groups. The distribution of signals aligns with the molecular structure, where the benzothiazine core, sulfonamide, and aliphatic substituents dominate the spectral features. The HSQC data effectively maps protonated carbons, aiding in assigning the molecule’s connectivity and functional groups."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C7H13O6P (SMILES: COC(=O)CC(=O)CP(=O)(OC)OC). The spectrum displays three distinct proton resonances in the aliphatic region, consistent with the structural features of the compound. The most prominent peak, observed at approximately 6.0 ppm, corresponds to the methylene protons (CH2) adjacent to the phosphonate group (P=O). This signal appears as a doublet due to spin-spin coupling with the phosphorus nucleus (³¹P, spin ½), with a coupling constant (J) typically in the range of 10–20 Hz. The high chemical shift of this peak reflects the deshielding effect of the electronegative phosphonate group. A second peak at ~5.5 ppm, also a doublet, arises from the methylene protons (CH2) located between the ketone (C=O) and ester (COOCH3) functionalities. This environment is strongly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl groups, shifting the resonance downfield. The splitting pattern here may result from coupling with both the phosphorus atom and neighboring protons, though the phosphorus coupling dominates. The third peak, centered at ~4.0 ppm, is a singlet integrating to 6H, assigned to the two equivalent methoxy groups (OCH3) attached to the phosphorus atom. Their chemical shift is characteristic of alkoxy protons in phosphonates. The singlet morphology confirms the absence of proton-proton coupling in this symmetric environment. Notably, the ester methoxy group (COOCH3) is not distinctly resolved in this spectrum, likely overlapping with the phosphonate methoxy signals or appearing as a minor feature near 3.7 ppm. The absence of aromatic or olefinic signals (7–8 ppm) aligns with the fully aliphatic structure. The observed peak intensities and splitting patterns provide clear evidence for the molecular framework, including the phosphonate-adjacent CH2, the β-ketoester moiety, and the three methoxy substituents. This spectrum exemplifies how H-NMR distinguishes proton environments in phosphorus-containing compounds through chemical shift dispersion and heteronuclear coupling effects."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides a 2D correlation between directly bonded 1H and 13C nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the structure. The spectrum exhibits distinct clusters of cross-peaks corresponding to the molecule’s aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroatom-substituted regions. In the aliphatic region (1H δ 0.5–3.5 ppm; 13C δ 10–60 ppm), two prominent cross-peaks are observed. The first, at approximately 1H δ 1.2 ppm and 13C δ 20 ppm, corresponds to the methyl group (CH3) of the ethyl substituent (C(C)H3), while the second, at 1H δ 3.3 ppm and 13C δ 55 ppm, aligns with the methoxy group (OCH3). These shifts are consistent with typical sp3-hybridized carbons deshielded by electronegative oxygen. The aromatic region (1H δ 6.5–8.5 ppm; 13C δ 110–160 ppm) displays multiple cross-peaks, reflecting the molecule’s polyaromatic system. The benzene rings (c1cccc(-c2...)c1 and -c4ccccc4) contribute to a dense cluster of signals between 1H δ 7.0–7.8 ppm and 13C δ 120–140 ppm. The trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatic ring (-c2cc(C(F)(F)F)cc3...) shows deshielded protons (1H δ 7.8–8.2 ppm) due to the electron-withdrawing CF3 group, with corresponding 13C shifts near 125–135 ppm. The imidazole-like nitrogen-containing ring (ncn(-c4ccccc4)c23) introduces additional aromatic cross-peaks, with protons at 1H δ 7.5–8.0 ppm and carbons at 13C δ 130–150 ppm, reflecting the electron-deficient heterocycle. Notably, the spectrum lacks signals in the carbonyl region (13C δ 160–220 ppm), confirming the absence of ketone or carboxylic acid groups. The CF3 group itself is not directly visible in HSQC, as fluorine decoupling typically suppresses 13C-19F correlations, but its influence is evident through downfield shifts of adjacent aromatic protons and carbons. This HSQC spectrum effectively maps the protonated carbon framework of the molecule, highlighting the distinct electronic environments imposed by the methoxy, ethyl, trifluoromethyl, and heteroaromatic substituents.

The spectrum displays several prominent peaks that provide structural insights into the molecule. The molecular ion peak [M]+ is observed at m/z 456, corresponding to the calculated molecular weight of the compound (C19H26ClN5O4S: 455.95 Da). A significant peak at m/z 410 (M+ – 46) suggests the loss of a CO2Et fragment (46 Da), likely originating from the ethyl ester group attached to the thiazole ring. Another key fragment at m/z 285 (M+ – 171) may correspond to cleavage of the piperazine ring system, retaining the chloroimidazole and thiazole moieties. The base peak at m/z 157 (100% relative abundance) indicates a highly stable fragment, potentially arising from the thiazole ring system with adjacent functional groups. Adjacent peaks at m/z 156 and 158 suggest possible isotopic contributions or minor structural rearrangements. The presence of chlorine is evident from the characteristic isotope pattern: peaks at m/z 283 and 285 (3:1 intensity ratio) confirm the retention of the Cl atom in the 285 fragment. Additional peaks at m/z 300 and 301 may represent further fragmentation of the imidazole-thiazole core.

The absence of significant peaks above m/z 456 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity under the ionization conditions. These fragmentation patterns align with the proposed structure, particularly the presence of labile ester and amide bonds susceptible to cleavage. The spectrum provides critical evidence for the molecular framework, including the thiazole, imidazole, and piperazine components, while confirming the presence of chlorine via isotopic signatures."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C6H9BrO2 (SMILES: O=C(CBr)C1CCCO1). The spectrum displays distinct peaks characteristic of a ketone with a bromomethyl group and a tetrahydrofuran ring. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at ~4.0 ppm, corresponding to the two protons of the CH2Br group adjacent to the carbonyl. This signal is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of both the carbonyl and bromine atoms. In the region between 3.5–4.5 ppm, multiple overlapping peaks are observed, likely representing the protons on the tetrahydrofuran ring carbons adjacent to the oxygen atom. These protons experience moderate deshielding from the electronegative oxygen. A triplet at ~3.8 ppm (intensity ~0.03) and a doublet at ~4.2 ppm (intensity ~0.03) suggest coupling between the ring protons, consistent with the cyclic structure. A smaller peak at ~2.5 ppm (intensity ~0.01) corresponds to the methylene protons (CH2) in the ring further from the oxygen, which are less deshielded. The absence of signals in the aromatic region (6–8 ppm) confirms the lack of sp²-hybridized carbons. The integration ratios align with the molecular formula, reflecting 2H for the CH2Br group, 4H for the oxygen-adjacent ring protons, and 3H for the remaining ring protons. The splitting patterns and chemical shifts collectively validate the proposed structure, with the bromine and oxygen atoms significantly influencing the electronic environment of nearby protons."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C19H23NO3 (SMILES: CC(=O)c1c(OCCCCN)cccc1OCc1ccccc1). The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances corresponding to the structural features of the compound. The most prominent peak at ~4.0 ppm arises from the methylene protons (CH2) adjacent to the oxygen atom in the benzyl ether group (OCc1ccccc1), exhibiting a singlet due to its isolation from neighboring protons. A second significant singlet at ~2.1 ppm corresponds to the three protons of the acetyl methyl group (COCH3), which is deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl. In the aromatic region (6.8–8.0 ppm), multiple peaks reflect the complex splitting patterns of the two benzene rings. The protons on the substituted aromatic ring (c1c(OCCCCN)cccc1OC) appear as a series of multiplets between 6.8–7.5 ppm, influenced by electron-withdrawing effects of the ketone and ether substituents. The benzyl phenyl ring (c1ccccc1) contributes additional multiplets in this region, though its signals may overlap with those of the primary aromatic ring. A broad peak near ~8.5 ppm likely corresponds to the terminal amine protons (NH2) of the OCCCCN side chain, though their exact position may vary due to hydrogen bonding or solvent effects. The methylene protons of the OCCCCN chain (OCH2CH2CH2CH2NH2) appear as overlapping multiplets between 3.0–3.5 ppm, with the CH2 adjacent to oxygen (OCH2) shifted slightly downfield (~3.8 ppm) due to deshielding. The integration of peaks aligns with the molecular formula: the acetyl methyl (3H), benzyl CH2 (2H), OCH2 groups (4H total), aromatic protons (9H total), and amine protons (2H) collectively account for all 23 hydrogens. No unexpected peaks are observed, confirming the purity of the sample and the absence of impurities. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the structural motifs in C19H23NO3, including the ketone, ether linkages, aromatic systems, and amine functionality."

The spectrum exhibits several key features characteristic of its functional groups. A sharp, intense peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the ester group, consistent with the ethyl ester moiety in the structure. A broad absorption band near 3300 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the N–H stretching of the indazole ring, indicative of hydrogen bonding interactions. The aromatic C=C stretching vibrations of the benzene and pyridine rings appear as multiple peaks between 1600–1450 cm⁻¹, reflecting the conjugated π-system. A distinct peak at 1250 cm⁻¹ arises from C–O stretching in the ester linkage, while the methoxy (–OCH₃) group contributes to absorptions near 1100 cm⁻¹. Notably, a minor peak at 2350 cm⁻¹ may represent an overtone or combination band, though it does not align with typical fundamental vibrations for this molecule. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex patterns from bending vibrations of C–H, N–H, and C–N bonds, further confirming the molecular framework.

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 211, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. The base peak at m/z 211 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions used. Notable fragment ions are observed at m/z 193, 194 (loss of 18 Da and 17 Da, respectively), suggesting elimination of water (H2O) and ammonia (NH3) from the parent ion, consistent with the presence of hydroxyl (-COH) and amino (-NH2) functional groups in the structure. Additional significant peaks at m/z 149, 150, and 151 correspond to cleavage of the morpholine ring (N2CCOCC2) and the pyrimidine-like core (Nc1ncc(CO)cn1), with the m/z 149 peak likely representing a tropylium ion-like fragment stabilized by the aromatic system. The peak at m/z 123 may arise from further fragmentation of the heterocyclic backbone, while the m/z 106 and 108 peaks suggest the presence of a chlorinated byproduct or isotope effect, though the molecular formula does not include chlorine. Lower-intensity peaks at m/z 55 and 70 correspond to small aliphatic fragments, possibly from the morpholine ring opening. The overall fragmentation pattern supports the proposed structure, with key diagnostic ions aligning with the functional groups and connectivity described by the SMILES notation.

The spectrum displays characteristic proton resonances across a chemical shift range of 0–14 ppm, reflecting the molecule's structural complexity. Key features include: 1. **Aliphatic region (0–3 ppm):** - A prominent singlet at ~0.9 ppm corresponds to the methyl groups of the isopropyl substituent (CH(CH3)2), typical for terminal aliphatic protons. - Multiplets at ~1.3–1.6 ppm and ~2.0 ppm arise from methylene (CH2) and methine (CH) protons in the aliphatic backbone, including the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl (COCH2) and the branched isopropyl moiety. - A peak at ~2.3 ppm likely represents the methylene protons (COCH2) adjacent to the ester carbonyl, deshielded by the electronegative oxygen. 2. **Methoxy group (~3.6–4.0 ppm):** - A singlet at ~3.7 ppm corresponds to the methoxy (OCH3) protons of the ester functionality, a hallmark of methyl esters in H-NMR spectra. 3. **Aromatic and heteroaromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm):** - Peaks at ~7.0–7.5 ppm are attributed to the aromatic protons of the indole ring system (c2cn(c3ccccc23)), with the indole NH proton typically appearing as a broad singlet near ~8.0 ppm due to hydrogen bonding and deshielding effects. - Additional signals in this region may overlap with protons from the adjacent aromatic benzene ring (c3ccccc23). 4. **Amide and deshielded protons (8–12 ppm):** - A sharp peak at ~11.0 ppm is indicative of a highly deshielded proton, likely the indole NH, which experiences strong ring-current effects and hydrogen bonding. - A broad peak at ~8.5 ppm may correspond to the secondary amide NH (NHC=O) in the macrocyclic lactam, though its exact position depends on solvent and hydrogen-bonding interactions. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s hybrid structure, combining aliphatic, aromatic, and heterocyclic motifs. The integration of peaks (not shown) would further confirm the relative proton counts, while splitting patterns (e.g., doublets, multiplets) provide insights into coupling interactions.

The peak near 60 ppm is attributed to the chiral carbon ([C@H]) bonded to the amide nitrogen and cyclohexyl group, while the 40 ppm peak corresponds to the adjacent methylene (CH2) linked to the nitrile. 4. **Nitrile Group:** The nitrile carbon (N#C) typically appears between 110–120 ppm, overlapping with aromatic signals here. Its exact assignment may require comparison with proton-coupled spectra or DEPT data. 5. **Low-Intensity Peaks:** Minor resonances (e.g., ~30 ppm) likely represent less abundant isotopic species (e.g., ¹³C satellites) or minor conformational isomers. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s structural diversity, including aromatic, carbonyl, nitrile, and aliphatic moieties.

The most prominent feature is a sharp, high-intensity peak near 50 ppm, characteristic of methoxy (-OCH3) carbons, consistent with the four methoxy substituents in the structure. Additional signals in the 10–20 ppm range likely correspond to aliphatic carbons, though their low intensity suggests minimal aliphatic content. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the substituted benzene rings.

Notably, peaks near 160–170 ppm are indicative of carboxylic acid carbonyl carbons, confirming the presence of the two -COOH groups. A minor peak near 200 ppm may represent a carbonyl impurity or a minor tautomeric form, though the primary structure lacks ketone functionality. The spectrum’s complexity arises from the molecule’s conjugated aromatic system and electron-withdrawing substituents, which deshield specific carbons and split signals due to non-equivalent environments. The absence of signals below 100 ppm, except for methoxy groups, supports the lack of sp3-hybridized carbons beyond the methoxy moieties.

The observed cross-peaks correspond to specific 1H-13C pairs, enabling assignment of chemical environments. In the aliphatic region (1H: 0–4 ppm; 13C: 10–50 ppm), a prominent cross-peak at approximately 3.8 ppm (1H) and 55 ppm (13C) reflects the methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to the aromatic ring.

The hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) in the tert-butyl alcohol moiety is evident as a cross-peak at ~3.5 ppm (1H) and 65 ppm (13C), consistent with its deshielded proton and carbon in an oxygenated environment. The aromatic region (1H: 6–8 ppm; 13C: 110–160 ppm) displays multiple cross-peaks.

The absence of peaks in the 100–120 ppm (13C) range confirms no sp2-hybridized carbons beyond the aromatic systems. This HSQC spectrum effectively maps the molecule’s 1H-13C connectivity, validating the presence of aromatic rings, oxygenated functional groups (-OCH3, -CH2OH, -COO-), and aliphatic substituents.

The most downfield peak near 160 ppm likely arises from the quaternary carbon in the quinazoline ring (C2 position), which is deshielded due to adjacent nitrogen atoms. Peaks at ~120–140 ppm correspond to aromatic carbons in the indole ring (e.g., C3, C4, and C6 positions) and the methoxy-substituted benzene ring. The indole’s C3 position (bearing a methyl group) and the quinazoline’s C6 position (adjacent to the methoxyethoxy chain) contribute to this region. 2. **Aliphatic Region (0–50 ppm):** Peaks in this range reflect aliphatic carbons, including the two methyl groups on the indole ring (~10–20 ppm) and the propyl linker (OCH2CH2CH2N) between the benzene and pyrrolidinone moieties. The methoxy group (OCH3) appears as a sharp peak near 50 ppm. The pyrrolidinone ring’s carbons (N1CCCC1=O) are distributed between 20–40 ppm, with the carbonyl carbon (C=O) expected near 170 ppm, though this region is not fully visible in the spectrum. 3. **Heteroatom-Substituted Carbons:** The methoxy group (OCH3) at ~50 ppm and the oxygen-bound methylene (OCH2) in the propyl chain (~60–70 ppm) are consistent with electronegative atom effects. The quinazoline’s C7 position (adjacent to the OCH2CH2CH2N chain) may contribute to the ~100–110 ppm range due to deshielding by the adjacent oxygen. 4. **Peak Intensity and Splitting:** The spectrum shows varying intensities, with the most intense peaks in the aromatic region reflecting the high density of aromatic carbons. The absence of significant splitting suggests a lack of strong scalar coupling in this proton-decoupled experiment, typical for C-NMR. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the molecular structure, highlighting the aromatic core, aliphatic substituents, and heteroatom-bound carbons.

The ¹H dimension (x-axis) spans ~14 to -2 ppm, while the ¹³C dimension (y-axis) ranges from ~0 to 200 ppm. Key features include: 1. **Carbohydrate region (δH 3–5.5 ppm / δC 60–100 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this area correspond to the glucopyranose ring (C1–C6). The anomeric proton (H1) appears near δH ~5.2 ppm with its attached carbon (C1) at δC ~98 ppm. Other ring protons (H2–H6) show correlations between δC 60–80 ppm, consistent with oxygenated carbons in the sugar moiety. 2. **Aliphatic region (δH 0.5–3 ppm / δC 10–40 ppm):** Peaks at δH ~0.9–1.0 ppm (δC ~18–20 ppm) are assigned to the isopropyl methyl groups (CH(CH₃)₂).

The ¹H shifts above 10 ppm suggest deshielded protons, likely due to electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine substituents and nitrogen atoms in the heterocycles. The ¹³C shifts between 100–150 ppm confirm the presence of aromatic carbons, including those adjacent to nitrogen (e.g., in the imidazole and quinoline-like moieties) and chlorinated phenyl rings. The distribution of peaks suggests non-equivalent environments for protons and carbons across the three aromatic systems, with the imidazole ring (n2ccnc2) and the fused quinoline-like structure (nc3ccccn23) contributing to the observed chemical shift dispersion. Notably, the spectrum lacks peaks in the aliphatic region (0–5 ppm for ¹H and 0–50 ppm for ¹³C), confirming the absence of sp³-hybridized carbons in the molecule.

A secondary, less intense peak around 1650 cm⁻¹ likely arises from the amide C=O stretching vibration, reflecting the presence of the secondary amide group (C(=O)NC) in the structure. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), multiple peaks are observed. The aromatic C–H bending vibrations appear as weak absorptions near 750–900 cm⁻¹, while the C–O stretching vibrations from both the ether (COc) and ester (C–O–C) linkages manifest as strong bands in the 1000–1300 cm⁻¹ range. The aromatic ring system also contributes to the complex absorption pattern between 1450–1600 cm⁻¹, attributed to C=C stretching vibrations. The presence of halogen substituents (Br and F) is inferred indirectly: the electron-withdrawing effects of these atoms influence the vibrational frequencies of adjacent bonds, though their direct C–Br and C–F stretching modes typically occur at lower wavenumbers (below 500 cm⁻¹) and are not prominently resolved in this spectrum. Overall, the IR data aligns with the structural features of the molecule, confirming the presence of ester, amide, ether, hydroxyl, and halogenated aromatic functionalities."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks that correlate with the molecular structure. The most prominent feature is a singlet at ~12 ppm, characteristic of an amide proton (C(N)=O), which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing effects of the carbonyl group. Adjacent to this, a sharp singlet at ~10 ppm likely corresponds to a proton on the pyrimidine ring (ncnc), which is deshielded by the adjacent nitrogen atoms. A third high-intensity singlet at ~4 ppm suggests a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to an electronegative oxygen atom in the piperidine ring ([C@H]3CCCNC3), where the oxygen’s inductive effect shifts the signal downfield. In the aromatic region (6–8 ppm), multiple smaller peaks are observed, consistent with protons on the thiazole (sc2) and benzene rings. The benzene ring, substituted with a trifluoromethyl group (CF3) and an ether-linked piperidine, exhibits deshielded protons due to the electron-withdrawing CF3 group, which typically shifts aromatic protons downfield. The thiazole ring’s proton (position 4) may contribute to a peak near 7–8 ppm, while the pyrimidine ring’s proton (position 6) could overlap with these signals. The piperidine ring’s aliphatic protons appear as a series of low-intensity peaks between 1.5–3 ppm, though these are less distinct in the spectrum. The absence of signals below 2 ppm suggests rapid exchange or overlapping of the secondary amine (NH) proton in the piperidine ring. The CF3 group itself does not produce H-NMR signals but influences the chemical shifts of nearby protons. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected features of the molecule, including deshielded aromatic and heterocyclic protons, an amide NH, and oxygen-adjacent aliphatic protons, providing a clear fingerprint of its structural components."

The HSQC spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing key structural features of the molecule. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm in ¹H, 100–160 ppm in ¹³C), multiple cross-peaks are observed, consistent with the two substituted aromatic rings in the structure. The proton chemical shifts near 7.5–8.0 ppm likely correspond to aromatic protons on the pyridine-like ring (containing the Cl substituent), while those at 6.5–7.0 ppm may arise from the methoxy-substituted benzene ring. The ¹³C shifts in the 120–150 ppm range align with sp²-hybridized carbons in aromatic systems, with deshielding effects from electronegative substituents (Cl, OMe) causing downfield shifts. A prominent cross-peak at ~10 ppm (¹H) and ~125 ppm (¹³C) suggests a proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, likely the carbonyl (C=O) in the central ketone moiety. The methoxy groups (–OCH3) are evident in the aliphatic region, with ¹H shifts at ~3.5–4.0 ppm and ¹³C shifts at ~55–60 ppm, reflecting their oxygen-bound methyl carbons. The methyl group (–CH3) attached to the pyridine ring appears as a cross-peak near ~2.5 ppm (¹H) and ~20 ppm (¹³C). Notably, the absence of correlations in the 160–200 ppm ¹³C region confirms the lack of carboxylic acid or ester carbonyl carbons, consistent with the ketone functionality in the structure. The spectrum also highlights the influence of chlorine substitution: the pyridine ring’s proton adjacent to Cl exhibits a downfield shift (7.8–8.2 ppm) due to the halogen’s electronegativity. Additionally, the lack of long-range ¹H–¹³C correlations (e.g., via HMBC) in this HSQC spectrum is expected, as HSQC exclusively detects one-bond couplings. Overall, the observed correlations align with the proposed structure, validating the connectivity of aromatic rings, methoxy substituents, and the ketone group in C18H20ClNO5."

The base peak at m/z 261 represents a significant fragmentation pathway involving the loss of 18 Da (likely H2O), suggesting the presence of a hydroxyl or carbonyl group susceptible to dehydration. Additional major peaks at m/z 146 and 120 indicate further cleavage of the molecular framework. The m/z 146 fragment may arise from the rupture of the heterocyclic ring system, releasing a stable aromatic-containing moiety, while the m/z 120 peak could correspond to a phenyl-substituted nitrogenous fragment.

The presence of multiple high-m/z peaks (e.g., 207, 232) suggests partial retention of the core structure during fragmentation. The spectrum’s pattern aligns with the proposed SMILES structure, which features a benzofuran-like ring (c3ccccc3OCC2) fused to a hydrazine-derived heterocycle (NN=C2), with a phenyl substituent (c1ccccc1). The observed fragments highlight the stability of aromatic systems and the influence of heteroatoms (N, O) on fragmentation pathways, including charge retention on nitrogen-rich fragments.

The 1H chemical shifts range from ~0 to 14 ppm, while the 13C shifts span ~0 to -200 ppm (note: typical 13C shifts are positive, suggesting the axis may be inverted for visualization). Distinct cross-peaks are observed, corresponding to directly bonded 1H-13C pairs. The most prominent peaks include: 1. A cluster of aliphatic signals between 1H 0.5–2.5 ppm and 13C -10 to -40 ppm (equivalent to ~10–40 ppm in standard notation), consistent with the cyclohexyl ring (C1CCCCC1) and methyl/methylene groups of the ethyl ester. The cyclohexyl CH2 groups exhibit moderate 1H shifts (~1.2–1.8 ppm) and 13C shifts (~25–30 ppm), reflecting their non-conjugated, saturated environment. 2.

The absence of peaks in the 13C -160 to -180 ppm range (160–180 ppm standard) confirms the presence of carbonyl carbons (ester and carboxylic acid), which lack directly attached protons and thus do not produce HSQC signals. Similarly, the carboxylic acid proton (expected ~10–12 ppm) is not observed, likely due to rapid exchange or suppression in the experiment. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, validating the connectivity of the ethyl ester, carboxylic acid, and cyclohexyl moieties. The HSQC data provide critical evidence for the molecular framework, particularly the central CH environment and aliphatic regions."

The peak at ~50 ppm (intensity ~0.06) corresponds to the methylene carbon (CH2) adjacent to the ester carbonyl, which is deshielded due to its proximity to the electron-withdrawing C=O group. Two additional low-intensity peaks at ~30 ppm (intensity ~0.04) and ~20 ppm (intensity ~0.02) may represent minor impurities or residual solvent signals, as they do not align with expected chemical shifts for the target molecule. The peak at ~10 ppm (intensity ~0.01) is likely an artifact or noise, given its minimal intensity. Overall, the spectrum confirms the presence of all ten carbons in the molecule, with distinct chemical shifts reflecting the electronic effects of functional groups and the symmetry of the para-substituted aromatic ring.

The molecular ion peak at m/z 389 corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 388.39 g/mol for C23H20N2O2S. This peak confirms the intact molecular mass and supports the proposed formula. A dominant fragment at m/z 91, representing the base peak (100% relative abundance), is characteristic of a tropylium ion (C7H7+), likely originating from cleavage of the benzyl ether group (OCc2ccccc2) attached to the quinolone ring. A smaller peak at m/z 92 may correspond to a related benzyl-derived fragment with an additional hydrogen. Additional significant fragments include m/z 190, 283, 299, and 377. The peak at m/z 190 suggests a stable fragment retaining the benzothiophene-piperidine moiety (C12H10NS+), formed via cleavage of the quinolone-benzothiophene bond. The m/z 299 and 283 peaks likely arise from further fragmentation of the benzothiophene-piperidine system, potentially involving loss of small neutral species such as C2H4 (28 Da) or H2S (34 Da). The m/z 377 peak, 12 Da below the molecular ion, may indicate loss of a carbon atom, though this requires further structural validation. The absence of significant isotope peaks for sulfur (e.g., m/z 391, corresponding to 34S) suggests low natural abundance of the 34S isotope in this sample. The overall fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the benzyl ether, quinolone core, and benzothiophene-piperidine system. These observations confirm the molecular identity and provide evidence for key structural motifs through characteristic mass losses and stable ion formation."

The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances characteristic of the described structure. A prominent singlet at ~10.5 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), which is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl and oxygen atoms. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, likely representing the five protons of the phenyl ring (c1ccccc1) in a monosubstituted configuration. These protons exhibit splitting patterns consistent with meta- and para-coupling, though overlapping signals complicate precise assignment. A sharp singlet at ~5.2 ppm suggests a proton on the isoxazole ring (noc1-c1ccccc1), specifically the hydrogen adjacent to the oxygen atom, which is deshielded by the electronegative heteroatom. The aliphatic region (0.5–3 ppm) contains several resonances: a triplet at ~0.9 ppm (integration ~3H) corresponds to the terminal methyl group of the butyl chain (CCCC-), while multiplets at ~1.3–1.7 ppm (~6H) and ~2.5–2.8 ppm (~2H) represent the methylene protons of the butyl chain, with the latter deshielded by proximity to the aromatic isoxazole ring. The absence of signals above 12 ppm confirms no additional acidic protons beyond the carboxylic acid, and the lack of peaks below 0 ppm rules out highly shielded environments. Integration ratios align with the molecular formula, supporting the assignment of 1H (COOH), 5H (phenyl), 1H (isoxazole), and 9H (butyl chain). This spectrum provides clear evidence of the proposed structure, with chemical shifts and splitting patterns consistent with the functional groups and connectivity described in the SMILES notation."

The spectrum exhibits several distinct peaks that correlate with the molecular structure. A prominent singlet at 11.5 ppm is attributed to the carboxylic acid proton (-COOH), which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent carbonyl group. A sharp singlet at 2.5 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the triazole ring, consistent with its typical chemical shift range for aliphatic methyl groups. In the aromatic region (7.0–7.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the four aromatic protons of the methoxyphenyl group. These protons appear as a combination of doublets and multiplets due to the electron-donating methoxy substituent (-OCH3) creating a deshielded environment and splitting patterns typical of a monosubstituted benzene ring. A singlet at 6.5 ppm is assigned to the proton on the triazole ring (position 5), which is deshielded by the adjacent nitrogen atoms but shielded relative to the carboxylic acid proton. Notably, the methoxy group (-OCH3) expected around 3.8 ppm is absent in the spectrum, likely due to overlap with solvent signals (e.g., residual water or DMSO) or low integration sensitivity. The peak at 10.5 ppm may indicate an impurity or a minor tautomeric form, as the triazole ring in this structure lacks an NH group. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, with key features confirming the presence of the carboxylic acid, methyl, aromatic, and triazole moieties."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks corresponding to the protons in the molecule. The most prominent peak at 4.0 ppm (highest intensity) is assigned to the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the sulfonyl (SO2) group in the CH2OSO2Ph-Me moiety. This signal is slightly downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the sulfonyl group. Overlapping with this peak, a smaller contribution from the methoxy group (OCH3) on the pyridine ring may also be present, typically appearing as a singlet near 3.8 ppm. The peak at 2.4 ppm (moderate intensity) corresponds to the methyl group (CH3) on the tosyl (p-toluenesulfonyl) aromatic ring, which is deshielded by the adjacent sulfonyl group. In the aromatic region, the peak at 8.0 ppm (moderate intensity) is attributed to the pyridine ring proton at position 6, which is ortho to the nitrogen atom and thus strongly deshielded. Additional aromatic protons from both the pyridine and tosyl rings appear as a smaller peak near 6.5 ppm. These include the pyridine protons at positions 3 and 4, which are influenced by the electron-donating methoxy group at position 2, and the tosyl ring protons ortho and meta to the sulfonyl group. The tosyl ring’s aromatic protons typically resonate between 7.3–8.0 ppm, with ortho protons appearing more downfield due to the sulfonyl group’s inductive effect. Minor peaks at 10–11 ppm (low intensity) are likely impurities or artifacts, as the molecule lacks exchangeable protons (e.g., OH or NH). The absence of signals in the 1–3 ppm range (excluding the methyl group) confirms no aliphatic protons beyond the CH2 and CH3 groups. This spectrum aligns with the structural features of the compound, including the pyridine core, tosyl group, and methoxy substitution."

Key features include a prominent peak near 160 ppm, corresponding to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group, which typically appears in the 150–165 ppm range due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen atoms. Aromatic carbons from the methoxy-substituted benzene ring are observed between 110–140 ppm, with the methoxy carbon (O–CH3) appearing as a sharp signal near 55 ppm, characteristic of alkoxy groups. The sulfonyl group (SO2) adjacent to a methylene (CH2) induces a resonance around 50–60 ppm for the CH2 carbon, reflecting deshielding by the electronegative sulfur and oxygen atoms.

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule’s structural complexity. Key features include: 1. **Carbonyl Region (160–200 ppm):** A prominent peak near 170 ppm corresponds to the two carbonyl carbons (C=O) from the acetamide (NC(C)=O) and the amide (C(=O)N) groups. These signals are typical for sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons in amide environments, with slight shifts due to electronic effects from adjacent substituents. 2. **Aromatic Region (100–160 ppm):** Multiple peaks between 110–150 ppm arise from the aromatic carbons in the two benzene rings (c1ccc(C#N)cc1 and c1ccc(NC(C)=O)cc1). The nitrile-substituted ring exhibits higher-field shifts (110–130 ppm) due to the electron-withdrawing C#N group, while the acetamide-substituted ring shows slightly downfield shifts (130–150 ppm) from the electron-donating NHAc group. 3. **Nitrile Carbon (~115 ppm):** A sharp peak near 115 ppm is attributed to the sp-hybridized carbon of the nitrile group (C#N), consistent with its high deshielding effect. 4. **Aliphatic Region (0–60 ppm):** Peaks in this range include the methoxy group (OCH3) at ~55 ppm and the methylene carbon (CH2) adjacent to the amide nitrogen at ~45 ppm. The methyl group of the acetamide (NC(C)=O) appears as a weaker signal near 25 ppm, typical for sp³-hybridized methyl carbons. The spectrum’s peak multiplicities and intensities align with the molecule’s symmetry and substitution patterns. For instance, the two equivalent aromatic carbons ortho to the nitrile group may coalesce into a single peak, while the acetamide-substituted ring’s asymmetry generates distinct resonances for each aromatic carbon. The absence of signals above 200 ppm confirms no aldehyde or ketone functionalities, and the lack of broad peaks suggests minimal hydrogen bonding effects on carbon shielding. This C-NMR data provides critical insights into the molecule’s electronic environment, corroborating its structural features and functional group assignments."

The base peak at m/z 250 indicates high stability of the intact ion under the ionization conditions. Key fragment peaks are observed at m/z 230, 180, 176, 167, 166, 149, 148, 137, 118, 112, 111, 110, 109, and 80, reflecting characteristic fragmentation pathways. The peak at m/z 230 (250 - 20) suggests loss of HF, a common fragmentation for organofluorine compounds, likely originating from the cyclobutyl fluoride moiety. The peak at m/z 180 may arise from cleavage of the C-O bond in the trifluoromethoxy group (OCF3), releasing a neutral OCF3 radical (mass 85) and leaving a cationic fragment (250 - 85 = 165), though the observed m/z 180 implies additional rearrangement or hydrogen transfer. The peak at m/z 176 (250 - 74) could correspond to loss of the entire OCF3 group as a neutral species (CFO, mass 74), leaving a pyridine-cyclobutyl fragment. The cluster of peaks at m/z 167, 166, and 149 may result from further fragmentation of the pyridine ring or cyclobutyl group. For instance, m/z 149 (250 - 101) could involve loss of the cyclobutyl fluoride (C4H4F, mass 77) and a neutral fragment (e.g., COF2, mass 66), though exact assignments require isotopic confirmation. The peaks at m/z 111, 110, and 109 likely correspond to pyridine-based fragments, such as C6H4NF+ (m/z 111) or C5H5N+ (pyridinium ion, m/z 78) with additional substituents. The peak at m/z 80 is consistent with the pyridinium ion (C5H4N+, m/z 78) plus two fluorine atoms, suggesting retention of halogenated substituents during fragmentation. The presence of multiple fluorine atoms is evidenced by the distinct fragmentation patterns, including HF elimination and the stability of fluorinated fragments. The spectrum highlights the influence of the OCF3 and cyclobutyl fluoride groups on the molecule’s dissociation behavior, with dominant pathways involving cleavage of C-F and C-O bonds. These features collectively support the structural assignment of the compound as a fluorinated pyridine derivative with a trifluoromethoxy substituent and a fluorinated cyclobutyl ring."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks in the aliphatic region, consistent with the molecular structure. The most prominent feature is a sharp, high-intensity singlet at approximately 1.0 ppm, which corresponds to the six equivalent protons of the cyclohexyl ring (C1CCCCC1) in a relatively shielded environment. Adjacent to this, a smaller triplet-like signal near 1.5 ppm may arise from the two protons on the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the tertiary carbon bearing the methyl and aminomethyl substituents. A moderately intense multiplet at ~2.2 ppm suggests protons on a methylene group (CH2) near the nitrogen atom of the pyrrolidine ring, influenced by the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent nitrogen. The peak at ~3.0 ppm, appearing as a doublet or triplet, likely corresponds to the two protons of the aminomethyl group (CH2NH2), which are deshielded due to the proximity of the amine functionality. Additionally, a small peak near 4.0 ppm could be attributed to the proton on the carbon adjacent to the ring nitrogen (e.g., the C-H of the pyrrolidine ring), though its low intensity suggests limited coupling or overlap with other signals. The absence of aromatic or olefinic peaks (6–8 ppm) confirms the lack of unsaturated bonds, aligning with the fully saturated formula.

The ion at m/z 296 (relative abundance ~40%) suggests further loss of water (H2O, 18 Da) from the m/z 314 fragment, indicating hydroxyl group elimination. A significant peak at m/z 215 (relative abundance ~50%) corresponds to the cleavage of the triazole ring (C3H3N3) and adjacent carbon atoms, retaining the pyridine ring with the trifluoromethyl group (-C(F)(F)F). This fragmentation is consistent with the stability of the electron-deficient pyridine moiety. Additional peaks at m/z 201 and 197 (relative abundances ~30% and ~25%, respectively) may result from homolytic cleavage of the propyl chain (-CH(CH3)CH2CH3) attached to the triazole ring, generating smaller alkyl fragments.

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule's complex aromatic and heterocyclic structure. Key features include a prominent peak at ~100 ppm, likely corresponding to the alkyne carbon (C#C) in the ethynyl linker between the thiophene and pyrazole rings. A cluster of intense signals between 120–140 ppm arises from aromatic carbons in the thiophene, pyrazole, and two trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl rings. These shifts are consistent with electron-withdrawing effects from the CF3 groups and sulfonamide moiety, which deshield adjacent carbons. Notably, two sharp peaks near 125 ppm and 130 ppm may represent the CF3-bearing aromatic carbons, as trifluoromethyl groups typically induce downfield shifts in adjacent ring positions. The absence of signals above 160 ppm confirms the lack of carbonyl or highly deshielded quaternary carbons. Additional peaks at ~150 ppm could correspond to the pyrazole ring carbons adjacent to nitrogen atoms, while the thiophene ring carbons appear in the 110–130 ppm range. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s multiple conjugated systems and symmetry-breaking substituents, such as the sulfonamide and CF3 groups. Integration of peak intensities aligns with the molecular formula, showing proportional contributions from the 20 unique carbon environments. This C-NMR data provides critical insights into the electronic and structural characteristics of the compound, particularly the influence of fluorine and heteroatom substituents on aromatic ring shielding."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. Key features include a prominent peak near 0 ppm, likely corresponding to the terminal methyl group of the ethoxy substituent (CH3-CH2-O-), which typically resonates in the 10–20 ppm region but may shift slightly due to electronic effects. Peaks between 20–60 ppm arise from aliphatic carbons, including the ethoxy methylene (CH2), piperidine ring carbons (from the CN2CCC(N...)CC2 moiety), and morpholine ring carbons (N4CCOCC4). These regions are consistent with sp³-hybridized carbons adjacent to electronegative atoms (oxygen, nitrogen), which deshield the nuclei and shift signals downfield. A cluster of peaks between 110–140 ppm corresponds to aromatic carbons from the substituted phenyl ring (C6H3Cl(OEt)) and the pyridine ring (c3ccnc(N4CCOCC4)c3). The phenyl ring, substituted with electron-withdrawing Cl and OEt groups, exhibits distinct shifts for ortho, meta, and para carbons relative to the substituents. The pyridine ring carbons, particularly the nitrogen-adjacent carbons, contribute to resonances in this range. A sharp peak near 150 ppm likely represents the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the amide linkage (NC(=O)), which typically appears between 160–180 ppm but may shift slightly depending on conjugation and hydrogen bonding. The absence of peaks above 180 ppm confirms no additional carbonyl or highly deshielded carbons are present. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s structural diversity, with symmetry considerations reducing the total number of observed peaks relative to the 24 carbons in the formula. Overall, the chemical shifts align with the expected environments in the provided SMILES structure, validating the molecular framework through characteristic C-NMR signatures."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range, reflecting the proton environments in the molecule. A prominent singlet at ~12 ppm corresponds to the exchangeable proton of the carbamate NH group, which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl and aromatic thiazole ring. A second exchangeable proton, likely from the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) group, appears as a broad singlet near ~10 ppm, consistent with a hydroxyl proton involved in hydrogen bonding. In the aromatic region, two well-defined peaks at ~7.0 ppm and ~6.2 ppm correspond to the two thiazole ring protons. The proton adjacent to the nitrogen atom (position 5 in the thiazole ring) appears downfield (~7.0 ppm), while the proton adjacent to the sulfur atom (position 4) is slightly upfield (~6.2 ppm), reflecting the differing electronic effects of the heteroatoms. A singlet at ~2.0 ppm is assigned to the methylene (CH2) protons of the ethyl group in the carbamate moiety. The upfield shift of this signal relative to typical ethyl CH2 groups (~3.5–4.0 ppm) may arise from shielding effects or overlapping with other resonances. The absence of splitting suggests rapid rotation or unresolved coupling. Finally, a weak signal near ~4.0 ppm, though less intense, may correspond to the hydroxymethyl CH2 protons (CH2OH), which are often broadened due to exchange with the hydroxyl proton. The spectrum lacks peaks in the aldehyde (~9–10 ppm) or carboxylic acid (~10–12 ppm) regions, confirming the absence of such functional groups. The integration and splitting patterns are consistent with the molecular formula, though detailed coupling analysis would require higher resolution. Overall, the observed chemical shifts align with the structural features of CCOC(=O)Nc1nc(CO)cs1, including the carbamate, thiazole ring, and hydroxymethyl substituents."

In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, corresponding to the two benzene rings in the structure. The nitrile-substituted benzene ring (ring A) displays deshielded protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing nitrile group, appearing as a multiplet near 7.5–8.0 ppm. The tetralin system’s benzene ring (ring B) contributes additional aromatic signals around 7.0–7.5 ppm, reflecting its less sterically hindered environment. A prominent singlet at ~4.5 ppm is attributed to the methylene group (CH2) adjacent to the secondary amine, deshielded by the electronegative nitrogen and the aromatic ring. The NH proton itself appears as a broad peak near 2.5–3.0 ppm, consistent with hydrogen bonding or exchange broadening typical of secondary amines. Aliphatic protons from the tetralin’s cyclohexane ring are distributed across 1.5–3.0 ppm, with the CH group directly bonded to the amine appearing slightly downfield (~3.0 ppm) due to the inductive effect of nitrogen. The remaining cyclohexane protons exhibit complex splitting patterns in the 1.5–2.5 ppm range, reflecting their diastereotopic environments. The most intense peak at ~10 ppm is atypical for this structure and may represent an impurity, solvent artifact (e.g., water or DMSO), or exchangeable proton. Integration of the peaks aligns with the molecular formula: aromatic protons (8H), methylene (2H), NH (1H), and cyclohexane protons (7H). This spectrum confirms the presence of the nitrile, aromatic systems, and tetralin-amine framework, with chemical shifts and splitting patterns consistent with the proposed structure."

The rightmost peak at approximately 4 ppm (1H) and 20 ppm (13C) corresponds to the methyl group (CH3) attached to the pyridazine ring, consistent with the SMILES notation. This methyl group exhibits a relatively upfield 1H shift due to its aliphatic nature and proximity to the electron-withdrawing pyridazine nitrogen. The middle peak at ~10.5 ppm (1H) and ~110 ppm (13C) arises from an aromatic proton on one of the pyridazine rings, likely deshielded by adjacent nitrogen atoms. The leftmost peak at ~12.5 ppm (1H) and ~150 ppm (13C) represents a highly deshielded aromatic proton, possibly adjacent to multiple electronegative nitrogens or the hydrazine substituent (-NNH2), which significantly withdraws electron density. The 13C shifts at 20 ppm (methyl), 110 ppm (aromatic), and 150 ppm (aromatic) align with sp3-hybridized and sp2-hybridized carbons in heteroaromatic systems.

The spectrum displays correlations between 1H and 13C nuclei, revealing key structural features through distinct cross-peaks. In the aliphatic region (13C ~0–50 ppm, 1H ~1–4 ppm), multiple peaks correspond to the piperidine ring (C1–C4) and tert-butyl group of the Boc-protected amine. The tert-butyl methyl groups appear as a cluster of peaks near 13C ~28 ppm (1H ~1.4 ppm), characteristic of highly shielded sp3-hybridized carbons. The piperidine ring exhibits correlations for CH2 groups, with 13C shifts ~20–50 ppm and 1H shifts ~1.5–3.5 ppm, reflecting their proximity to the electron-withdrawing sulfonamide and nitrogen atoms. In the aromatic region (13C ~100–160 ppm, 1H ~6–8.5 ppm), cross-peaks arise from the quinoline moiety.

The sulfonamide-linked aromatic carbons (C1–C4 of the benzene ring) exhibit 13C shifts ~120–135 ppm, with 1H correlations ~7–7.5 ppm, consistent with electron-withdrawing effects of the sulfonyl group. Notably, the carbonyl carbon of the Boc group (~155 ppm in 13C) lacks a directly bonded proton, resulting in no HSQC correlation, as expected. The spectrum also lacks peaks for quaternary carbons (e.g., the Boc carbonyl or fluorinated quinoline carbon), which are invisible in HSQC due to the absence of attached hydrogens. Overall, the observed correlations align with the molecule’s structural features, including the Boc-protected amine, piperidine ring, sulfonamide-linked quinoline, and halogen substituents, providing a detailed map of protonated carbon environments."

The integration of all signals aligns with the molecular formula, confirming 13 protons. The absence of peaks in the aldehyde/ketone region (9–10 ppm) and the presence of distinct aromatic and aliphatic resonances support the proposed structure. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the molecule’s functional groups, including the thioether, oxazolidinone ring, and hydroxymethyl substituent."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption bands corresponding to key functional groups in the structure. A sharp, intense peak near 1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the methyl ester moiety, consistent with the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent sulfonamide group lowering the C=O stretching frequency slightly compared to a typical ester. Broad, strong absorptions between 1300–1100 cm⁻¹ arise from symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the sulfonyl (S=O) groups, confirming the presence of the sulfonamide functionality. Peaks near 3300 cm⁻¹ correspond to N–H stretching, indicating the secondary amine in the pyrrolidine ring is protonated. The aromatic C–H stretching vibrations appear as weak, sharp peaks between 3000–3100 cm⁻¹, while distinct bands near 700–800 cm⁻¹ are consistent with C–Cl stretching modes from the dichlorophenyl substituent. Additional features in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) reflect complex vibrational coupling involving C–O–C (ester), C–N, and aromatic ring deformations. The absence of broad O–H stretching bands confirms the lack of hydroxyl groups, aligning with the molecular formula. Overall, the spectral features corroborate the structural motifs of the methyl ester, sulfonamide, dichlorophenyl, and pyrrolidine components in the molecule."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 430, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 429 g/mol. The base peak at m/z 266 represents the most abundant fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the C–S bond in the sulfonyl group, generating a stabilized carbocation from the indole-derived fragment. Additional significant peaks at m/z 412, 413, and 414 suggest loss of water (Δm/z = 18) from the molecular ion, indicating the presence of a hydroxyl group in the structure. Fragmentation patterns in the m/z 250–270 range (e.g., 252, 264, 265, 267, 268) are consistent with isotopic contributions and structural rearrangements near the sulfone (SO2) moiety, while peaks at m/z 328, 330, and 331 may reflect retention of the sulfonyl group with partial ring fragmentation. Smaller peaks at m/z 145, 162, and 190 correspond to lower-mass fragments, such as the indole core (C8H7N) or substituted aromatic rings. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 430 confirms the molecular ion’s stability, and the overall fragmentation aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the sulfonated cyclohexyl group, hydroxylated indole, and tert-butyl ketone substituents. This spectrum provides clear evidence for the proposed molecular architecture through diagnostic mass losses and fragment ion stability."

The spectrum exhibits several key features characteristic of this compound's fragmentation pattern under mass spectrometry. The most prominent peak appears at m/z 91, corresponding to the benzyl cation (C7H7+), a highly stable fragment commonly observed in aromatic-containing molecules. This peak confirms the presence of the phenyl group (c1ccccc1) in the structure. A significant peak at m/z 278 suggests the loss of a tert-butyl group (C4H9, 57 Da) from the molecular ion, consistent with the BOC (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group on the piperidine nitrogen. This fragmentation aligns with the SMILES notation's CC(C)(C)OC(=O)N moiety. The peak at m/z 234 likely represents further cleavage of the BOC group, potentially involving loss of CO2 (44 Da) and the ethyl ester (C2H5O2, 75 Da), yielding a fragment retaining the core piperidine-benzyl scaffold. Additional notable peaks at m/z 160 and 188 may arise from fragmentation of the piperidine ring system, with m/z 160 potentially corresponding to a protonated piperidine derivative (C6H10NO2+) and m/z 188 indicating a fragment retaining part of the carbamate and ester functionalities. The peak at m/z 250 could represent a rearrangement ion involving the ethyl ester (C2H5O2) and adjacent carbon framework. The absence of a detectable molecular ion peak (expected at m/z 333) is typical for molecules with labile functional groups like esters and carbamates, which undergo rapid fragmentation. The observed peaks collectively validate the structural features of C19H27NO4, including the benzyl group, BOC-protected piperidine, and ethyl ester, while illustrating common fragmentation pathways such as α-cleavage and neutral losses of tert-butyl, CO2, and ethyl groups."

A broad, moderately intense peak near 3400 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the O-H stretching vibration of the terminal hydroxyl group in the ethylene glycol ether side chain. The sharp, intense absorption at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the ester moiety, which is slightly shifted lower than typical ester carbonyls due to conjugation with the adjacent alkene. The C=C stretching vibration of the α,β-unsaturated ester system appears as a medium-intensity band near 1600 cm⁻¹, overlapping with the aromatic ring C=C stretching modes observed as multiple peaks between 1450 and 1600 cm⁻¹. Additional diagnostic features include strong C-O stretching vibrations of the ester and ether groups near 1250 cm⁻¹ and 1100 cm⁻¹, respectively. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains complex multiplets arising from aromatic ring deformations, C-H in-plane bending, and C-O-C asymmetric stretching. Notably, the absence of significant absorption above 3600 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of free hydroxyl groups, while the lack of N-H or S-H stretches excludes amine or thiol functionalities.

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances characteristic of a bicyclic structure with carbonyl and aliphatic functionalities. The most prominent peak at ~175 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (C=O), reflecting its deshielded environment due to electronegative oxygen atoms. A sharp signal at ~155 ppm is attributed to the carbamate carbonyl carbon (Boc group), consistent with its partial double-bond character. The peak at ~80 ppm represents the quaternary carbon in the Boc group (C-O), which is deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atoms. Several resonances in the 50–25 ppm range correspond to aliphatic carbons in the cyclohexane and piperidine rings. The peak at ~50 ppm likely arises from the methylene carbons adjacent to the nitrogen atom (N-CH2), which experience moderate shielding. Peaks at ~30–35 ppm and ~25 ppm are assigned to the cyclohexane ring carbons, with the latter reflecting more shielded methylene groups in the ring’s equatorial positions. The absence of signals above 200 ppm or below 0 ppm confirms the lack of highly deshielded or shielded carbons, respectively. The spectrum’s peak distribution aligns with the molecular symmetry implied by the SMILES notation, particularly the equivalent carbons in the cyclohexane ring. The Boc group’s tert-butyl carbons (C(CH3)3) are not distinctly resolved here, likely due to rapid rotation averaging their environments. This C-NMR data provides clear evidence for the compound’s structural motifs, including the carbamate-protected amine, carboxylic acid functionality, and bicyclic framework."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of the 20 carbon atoms in the structure. Key features include: 1. **Carbonyl region (160–180 ppm)**: A prominent peak near 170 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid (–COOH) and amide (–CONH–) carbonyl carbons. These deshielded signals arise from the electron-withdrawing effects of the oxygen atoms in these functional groups. 2. **Aromatic region (110–160 ppm)**: Multiple peaks between 115–155 ppm represent the aromatic carbons of the imidazopyridine ring (c1cn2cnc1ccc2) and the fluorinated phenyl ring (c3cc(F)ccc3F). The fluorine substituents induce downfield shifts (120–130 ppm) for adjacent aromatic carbons due to their strong electronegativity. The nitrogen-containing heterocycle exhibits additional splitting due to the anisotropic effects of the ring current and nitrogen’s quadrupolar moment. 3. **Aliphatic region (20–60 ppm)**: Peaks in this range correspond to the –CH2– groups of the ethyl linker (–CH2COOH) and the pyrrolidine ring (N3CCC[C@H]3–). The methylene carbons adjacent to the amide nitrogen (–CH2NH–) appear slightly upfield (~30–40 ppm), while the pyrrolidine ring carbons show intermediate shifts (~25–50 ppm) due to their cyclic structure and proximity to nitrogen. 4. **Quaternary carbons**: A peak near 100 ppm may represent the quaternary carbon in the imidazopyridine ring (c1), which is deshielded by adjacent nitrogen atoms. The spectrum’s peak multiplicity and integration align with the molecular symmetry and substitution pattern. For instance, the fluorinated phenyl ring’s two equivalent fluorine atoms result in a pair of doublets for the ortho and meta carbons, while the imidazopyridine ring’s asymmetric substitution produces distinct resonances for each aromatic carbon. The absence of peaks below 0 ppm or above 200 ppm confirms the absence of highly shielded (e.g., alkyl silanes) or exceptionally deshielded (e.g., ketones) carbons. This C-NMR spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule’s structural framework, confirming the presence of aromatic heterocycles, fluorinated substituents, and aliphatic linkers while validating the assigned molecular formula and connectivity."

The spectrum displays four distinct cross-peaks, correlating proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts. 1. **Peak at ~8 ppm (¹H) and ~130 ppm (¹³C):** This corresponds to the aromatic protons ortho to the sulfonyl chloride group (-SO₂Cl) on the benzene ring. The electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group deshields these protons, shifting their resonance downfield to ~8 ppm. The associated carbon shifts (~130 ppm) are consistent with aromatic carbons adjacent to electronegative substituents. 2. **Peak at ~7 ppm (¹H) and ~50 ppm (¹³C):** This peak arises from the proton on the carbon bearing the bromine atom (CHBr). The bromine's strong deshielding effect and the adjacent ester carbonyl group shift the proton resonance to ~7 ppm. The carbon shift (~50 ppm) aligns with a CHBr group bonded to an sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbon. 3. **Peak at ~3 ppm (¹H) and ~20 ppm (¹³C):** This cross-peak represents the methylene protons (-CH₂-) of the ethyl ester group. The oxygen atom in the ester deshields these protons, resulting in a chemical shift near ~3 ppm. The carbon shift (~20 ppm) is typical for an aliphatic CH₂ group adjacent to an oxygen atom. 4. **Peak at ~12 ppm (¹H) and ~160 ppm (¹³C):** This peak is atypically downfield for both proton and carbon shifts. While the carbon shift (~160 ppm) suggests a carbonyl or conjugated system, the molecule's ester carbonyl carbon (~170 ppm) lacks a directly bonded proton and would not appear in HSQC. This peak may indicate an impurity, solvent artifact, or an unexpected tautomeric form, as no proton-carbon pair in the given structure justifies this correlation. The spectrum confirms the presence of aromatic, brominated aliphatic, and ester functionalities, aligning with the molecular formula and SMILES notation. The absence of additional peaks suggests symmetry in the aromatic system (para-substitution) and no significant conformational complexity."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption features corresponding to the functional groups present in this nucleoside analogue. A broad, intense band near 3300 cm⁻¹ arises from O-H stretching vibrations, indicative of the three hydroxyl groups in the ribose moiety, with hydrogen bonding contributing to the band's breadth. Sharp peaks around 2900 cm⁻¹ correspond to C-H stretching in the ribose ring and methyl or methylene groups, though these are relatively weak due to the molecule's polar nature. A prominent peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the conjugated ketone in the triazolopyrimidine ring system, consistent with the O=c1 moiety in the SMILES notation. This absorption is intensified by conjugation with the adjacent aromatic system. Additional sharp bands between 1600–1500 cm⁻¹ likely stem from C=N and C=C stretching vibrations in the fused heterocyclic rings, reflecting the molecule's aromatic character. The region between 1300–1000 cm⁻¹ displays multiple peaks from C-O stretching vibrations, including those from the ribose C-OH bonds and the glycosidic linkage (C-O-C) between the sugar and the triazolopyrimidine base. A distinct band near 1200 cm⁻¹ may correspond to asymmetric stretching of the C-O-C bridge. The fingerprint region (<1000 cm⁻¹) contains complex, overlapping peaks from out-of-plane ring deformations and skeletal vibrations of the heterocyclic system. Notably, the absence of strong absorptions near 2200 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of nitrile or alkyne groups, while the lack of sharp N-H peaks above 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests that the NH groups in the triazole and pyrimidine rings are either deprotonated or involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding. This spectrum collectively reflects the molecule's hybrid structure, combining a ribose sugar with a modified purine-like heterocycle containing a triazole ring and carbonyl functionality."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing insights into the molecule's proton-carbon connectivity. The spectrum displays two distinct cross-peaks, reflecting the chemical environments of aromatic protons and their attached carbons. The first cross-peak appears at approximately 10 ppm in the ¹H dimension and 125 ppm in the ¹³C dimension. This corresponds to aromatic protons in a highly deshielded environment, likely due to their proximity to the electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl (CF₃) groups. The ¹³C shift at 125 ppm is consistent with sp²-hybridized aromatic carbons, further supporting their location on the benzene rings adjacent to the central carbon bearing the CF₃ substituents. The second cross-peak is observed at ~7 ppm (¹H) and ~130 ppm (¹³C). These values align with aromatic protons in a less deshielded environment, possibly meta or para to the central carbon. The ¹³C shift at 130 ppm is typical for aromatic carbons in substituted benzene rings, suggesting these protons are part of the same phenyl groups but in positions less influenced by the CF₃ groups. Notably, the spectrum lacks peaks corresponding to the methyl (CH₃) groups (expected ~2–3 ppm in ¹H and ~20 ppm in ¹³C), likely due to the spectral window focusing on the aromatic region or signal overlap. The central quaternary carbon (attached to two CF₃ groups) is not visible in HSQC, as it lacks directly bonded protons. The observed cross-peaks reflect the molecule’s symmetry, where equivalent protons on the two phenyl rings produce simplified signals. The CF₃ groups induce significant deshielding in adjacent aromatic protons, explaining the downfield ¹H shift (10 ppm). This spectrum effectively illustrates the electronic effects of fluorinated substituents on aromatic systems and confirms the connectivity of protons to their respective carbons in the molecular framework."

The spectrum displays several key peaks that provide insights into the molecular structure and fragmentation patterns. The most prominent peak, observed at m/z 103, represents the base peak, indicating the most abundant fragment ion. This peak likely corresponds to the loss of the entire side chain from the tetrazole ring, leaving a methylated tetrazole fragment (C3H5N4+). The molecular ion peak [M+H]+ appears at m/z 277, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 276 g/mol for C13H16N4O3, confirming the molecular formula. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 130, 173, and 187. The peak at m/z 130 may arise from fragmentation of the ethyl ester linkage, producing a benzyl-type cation with partial retention of the ether oxygen. Peaks at m/z 173 and 187 suggest sequential losses of neutral fragments, such as water or carbon dioxide, from larger substructures. For instance, m/z 173 could correspond to the loss of the carboxylic acid group (–COOH, 45 Da) from the molecular ion, while m/z 187 might result from the elimination of a smaller neutral fragment (e.g., –CH2O, 30 Da) from the side chain. The presence of multiple peaks in the 90–116 m/z range indicates further breakdown of the aromatic ring and tetrazole moiety, with smaller fragments such as C6H5+ (m/z 77) or nitrogen-containing heterocyclic fragments contributing to the pattern. The peak at m/z 205 may represent a rearrangement ion involving the tetrazole and adjacent carbon atoms. Overall, the spectrum reflects the structural complexity of the molecule, with fragmentation pathways dominated by cleavage of the flexible side chain and stability of the aromatic and heterocyclic components. These features align with the proposed SMILES notation, where the tetrazole ring and substituted benzene contribute to distinct fragmentation behavior."

A sharp, intense peak near 160 ppm arises from the ester carbonyl carbon (C=O), strongly deshielded by the electronegative oxygen and adjacent nitrogen atom. In the aromatic region (100–150 ppm), multiple peaks reflect the heterocyclic pyrrolopyridine core.

The methylene group adjacent to the lactam nitrogen (CNCH2) is observed near 3.5 ppm, deshielded by the nitrogen's inductive effect. The spectrum’s overall intensity distribution aligns with the molecular structure, with no unexpected peaks, confirming the purity and identity of the compound. This H-NMR data provides clear evidence of the molecule's functional groups, including the ester, lactam, hydroxyl, and aromatic systems, as defined by the given SMILES notation."

A prominent peak at ~170 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the amide group, a hallmark of the butanamide moiety. Multiple resonances in the aromatic region (110–140 ppm) reflect the indazole core (positions 1–7) and the substituted phenyl ring (positions 3'–5'), with the hydroxyl-substituted phenyl ring likely contributing to the slightly deshielded signals near 140 ppm due to electron-withdrawing effects. Peaks in the aliphatic region (10–40 ppm) are attributed to the butyl chain, with the terminal methyl group appearing as a singlet near 10 ppm and methylene groups (CH2) distributed between 20–30 ppm. The absence of signals above 180 ppm confirms no additional carbonyl or highly deshielded carbons are present. The spectrum’s resolution and peak distribution align with the expected 17 unique carbon environments in the molecule, though some overlap may occur due to structural symmetry or similar electronic environments.

The most prominent peak at approximately 150 ppm arises from the carbon atom directly bonded to the electron-withdrawing trifluoromethoxy group (-OCF3), which significantly deshields the carbon due to the electronegativity of fluorine and oxygen. A secondary peak near 130 ppm corresponds to the carbon atom para to the bromine substituent on the benzene ring, reflecting moderate deshielding from the bromine’s inductive effect. Additional aromatic carbons appear between 110–125 ppm, representing the remaining ring carbons, which are less influenced by substituents. The peak at ~40 ppm is attributed to the methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to the primary amine (-NH2), consistent with typical aliphatic carbon shifts. Notably, the absence of peaks above 160 ppm confirms no carbonyl or highly conjugated carbons are present, while the lack of signals below 30 ppm rules out methyl or other saturated aliphatic groups.

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands that correlate with the functional groups present in this compound. A broad, moderately intense peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the N–H stretching vibration of the primary amine group, which is consistent with the chiral [C@H](N) moiety in the structure. Sharp, well-defined peaks around 3100–3000 cm⁻¹ are attributed to aromatic C–H stretching vibrations, while weaker aliphatic C–H stretches from the methyl groups (C–CH₃) appear near 2900 cm⁻¹. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), a prominent absorption near 1600 cm⁻¹ arises from C=C stretching in the aromatic ring, reflecting the conjugated π-system of the substituted benzene. A particularly intense, sharp peak near 1100 cm⁻¹ is indicative of C–F stretching vibrations, consistent with the trifluoromethyl group (CF₃) in the molecule. This band is highly characteristic of fluorinated organic compounds due to the strong polarity and high bond strength of C–F bonds. Additional weaker absorptions between 1000–600 cm⁻¹ likely correspond to C–Cl stretching and bending modes of the chlorine substituent, though these are less distinct due to overlap with other vibrational modes. The absence of significant absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of carbonyl (C=O) functionality in this compound. Overall, the IR spectrum aligns with the structural features of C10H11ClF3N, including the aromatic ring, amine, methyl groups, and halogen substituents.

The spectrum displays a molecular ion peak at m/z 359, corresponding to the intact molecule. The base peak at m/z 155 suggests a highly stable fragment, likely formed via cleavage of the sulfone (SO2) group and adjacent bonds, generating a resonance-stabilized ion. Prominent peaks at m/z 107 and 109 (with a 3:1 intensity ratio) indicate the presence of a chlorine atom, consistent with the molecular formula. Additional key fragments include m/z 125 (possibly a methyl-substituted cyclohexadienone ion), m/z 139 (loss of CO from the base peak), and m/z 209, which may arise from retention of the aromatic ring system with partial fragmentation of the aliphatic ketone groups. The cluster of peaks between m/z 223–281 suggests stepwise loss of small neutral species (e.g., CO, H2O, or CH3SO2), while the peak at m/z 341 corresponds to a loss of 18 Da (H2O) from the molecular ion. The isotopic pattern of peaks at m/z 155 and 157 (ratio ~3:1) further confirms the presence of chlorine in this fragment.

The molecular ion peak at m/z 461 corresponds to the intact molecule, confirming the molecular weight of 460.49 g/mol (calculated from the formula). Fragmentation patterns reveal key structural insights: the peak at m/z 196 likely represents a fragment retaining one sulfonamide group (C6H9N3O4S), while the m/z 249 peak may correspond to a larger fragment containing both heterocyclic rings and partial sulfonamide functionality. Notably, the m/z 170 peak aligns with a fragment resulting from cleavage of the N–S bond in the sulfonamide moiety, releasing a C5H8N3O3S+ ion. Smaller peaks at m/z 105–107 suggest the presence of methoxy-substituted pyrimidine fragments (C5H6N2O2+), while the m/z 213 peak could indicate a fragment retaining the pyridine ring with adjacent sulfonamide and methyl groups.

The spectrum displays four prominent peaks in the aromatic and deshielded regions, consistent with the structural features of the molecule. The most downfield signal appears at approximately 13.0 ppm, which is characteristic of a strongly deshielded proton, likely the indole N-H group. This high chemical shift reflects the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent trifluoromethanesulfonyl (triflate) group (-OSO2CF3) on the aromatic system, increasing the acidity of the N-H proton. A second prominent peak at ~10.0 ppm corresponds to an aromatic proton ortho to the sulfonate group. The electron-withdrawing nature of the triflate substituent deshields nearby protons, shifting their resonance downfield. A third signal at ~9.5 ppm may arise from another aromatic proton on the benzene ring, potentially meta or para to the sulfonate group, though its exact position depends on the ring’s substitution pattern. The largest peak at ~4.0 ppm is assigned to the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the indole core. Its relatively high chemical shift compared to typical aliphatic protons (usually ~2 ppm) suggests deshielding due to proximity to the electron-deficient aromatic system. The absence of signals in the aliphatic region (below 3 ppm) confirms no additional aliphatic protons are present. The sharpness of peaks indicates minimal coupling complexity, though the aromatic region may exhibit subtle splitting patterns not resolved in this spectrum. The triflate group’s fluorine atoms do not contribute to the H-NMR spectrum, as expected. Overall, the spectral features align with the molecular structure, highlighting the influence of the triflate substituent on proton environments and confirming the integrity of the indole core and methyl group."

Fluorine’s strong electronegativity deshields these protons, shifting their signals downfield. 2. **Alkyne/cyclobutyl region (2.5–3.5 ppm):** A multiplet at ~3.0 ppm corresponds to the methylene protons of the cyclobutyl group (C#CC3CCC3). The alkyne’s sp-hybridized carbons lack directly attached protons, but the adjacent cyclobutane ring’s protons exhibit coupling patterns due to ring strain and conformational rigidity. 3. **Tetrahydropyranyl (THP) ring (1.5–4.5 ppm):** A series of overlapping peaks between 1.5–4.0 ppm reflect the THP ring’s protons (C2CCCCO2).

The most downfield peak, appearing near 200 ppm, is characteristic of the aldehyde carbonyl carbon (C=O), which is highly deshielded due to the electronegativity of the oxygen atom. Adjacent to this, a smaller peak around 150 ppm corresponds to the carbamate carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the N-methyl carbamate group. This shift is consistent with carbonyl groups bonded to nitrogen and oxygen, which induce moderate deshielding. A prominent peak near 100 ppm is attributed to the central carbon of the tert-butyl group (C attached to three methyl groups and the carbamate oxygen). This carbon experiences deshielding due to its proximity to the electronegative oxygen atom. The peak at approximately 50 ppm corresponds to the chiral α-carbon (C adjacent to the aldehyde and nitrogen), which is deshielded by its attachment to both the nitrogen and the aldehyde group. Finally, the most intense peak near 0 ppm represents the nine equivalent protons of the three methyl groups in the tert-butyl moiety (C(C)(C)C), which are shielded due to their distance from electronegative atoms and their symmetric environment.

The peak at m/z 470 corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 469 g/mol for C20H18F3N3O5S. The m/z 438 peak likely represents a fragment resulting from the loss of methanol (CH3OH, 32 Da) from the molecular ion, forming [M - OCH3]+. This fragmentation is typical for ester-containing compounds, where cleavage at the carbonyl oxygen bond occurs.

Mid-range peaks at m/z 233, 284, and 337 indicate further fragmentation of the molecular backbone. The m/z 337 peak may result from cleavage of the N-aryl bond, retaining the sulfonyl and trifluoromethyl groups, while m/z 284 could correspond to a loss of the phenylalanine-derived side chain (C9H9N). The m/z 233 peak might reflect a fragment retaining the benzoxazole core with partial substitution. Notably, the spectrum lacks significant peaks between m/z 300–400, suggesting limited stability of intermediate fragments in this mass range. The absence of a detectable molecular ion (M+) at m/z 469 implies that the protonated form [M+H]+ dominates under the ionization conditions used. Overall, the spectral features align with the structural motifs of the molecule: the ester group, trifluoromethylsulfonyl substituent, and benzoxazole heterocycle.

These arise from the aromatic protons on both the quinazoline and benzodioxole rings, with splitting patterns influenced by their coupling interactions. The deshielded proton of the carboxylic acid (-COOH) appears as a broad singlet near 12.0 ppm, a characteristic shift due to hydrogen bonding and electron-withdrawing effects. A distinct singlet at ~10.5 ppm is attributed to the secondary amine proton (-NH-) linking the benzodioxole and quinazoline moieties, reflecting its moderate deshielding by the adjacent aromatic systems.

The absence of the molecular ion peak at m/z 390 implies extensive fragmentation under ionization conditions, typical for molecules with labile functional groups like carbamates. The isotopic peaks (e.g., m/z 275, 276) align with natural isotopic abundances of carbon and nitrogen, confirming the elemental composition of fragments. This spectrum highlights the molecule’s susceptibility to cleavage at the Boc-amine linkage and the stability of the nitrile-containing aromatic fragment (m/z 274), which serves as a diagnostic marker for structural elucidation."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon environments across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the structural complexity of the molecule. Key features include a prominent peak near 160 ppm, indicative of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) from the tert-butyl ester group. Aromatic carbons appear between 100–150 ppm, with multiple peaks suggesting substituted benzene ring environments, likely corresponding to the aniline and cyclohexene-linked aromatic system. Aliphatic carbons dominate the 0–60 ppm region, with intense signals near 20–30 ppm attributed to the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) and cyclohexene ring methyl/methylene carbons. The sharp peak at ~28 ppm aligns with the symmetric tert-butyl carbons, while broader signals in the 40–60 ppm range may correspond to the piperidine ring carbons and the cyclohexene bridgehead carbons. The absence of peaks above 200 ppm confirms no additional carbonyl or highly deshielded carbons are present. The spectrum’s resolution and peak distribution reflect the molecule’s rigid framework, with distinct chemical environments for aromatic, aliphatic, and carbonyl carbons. This pattern is consistent with the given structure, where the tert-butyl ester, piperidine, cyclohexene, and substituted aniline moieties contribute to the observed chemical shifts."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption features corresponding to functional groups in the structure. A sharp, intense peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) group, consistent with the ester moiety (CCOC=O) in the molecule. Broad absorption near 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests an O-H stretch, likely from the secondary alcohol group (OC[C@H](O)CO-), though its reduced intensity may imply intramolecular hydrogen bonding or partial overlap with C-H stretching vibrations. Peaks in the 2900–3000 cm⁻¹ region correspond to aliphatic C-H stretches from the ethyl (CCO-) and isopropyl (OC(C)C) groups, while weaker bands near 3050–3100 cm⁻¹ are attributed to aromatic C-H stretches from the benzene rings. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays multiple absorptions: strong bands near 1250–1000 cm⁻¹ arise from C-O stretching in the ester, ether (OC[C@H](O)CO-), and aromatic ether linkages, while peaks around 800–900 cm⁻¹ may reflect C-Cl stretching vibrations from the dichlorinated aromatic ring.

Key features include four prominent cross-peaks corresponding to distinct proton-carbon pairs. A peak at (10.2 ppm, 105 ppm) arises from the aldehyde proton (CHO) and its attached carbon, though the absence of a carbonyl carbon peak (expected near 180–200 ppm) suggests the ketone group (c(=O)) in the thiophene ring lacks directly bonded protons.

The spectrum displays four distinct resonances in the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, characteristic of a bicyclic heteroaromatic system. The most downfield peak, observed near 150 ppm, corresponds to the aromatic carbon adjacent to the pyridine nitrogen, which experiences strong deshielding due to the electronegativity of the nitrogen atom and the electron-deficient nature of the aromatic ring. A second aromatic carbon resonance appears near 120 ppm, likely representing a carbon within the pyridine ring that is less directly influenced by the nitrogen’s inductive effect. Two aliphatic resonances are observed in the upfield region: a peak near 50 ppm and another near 30 ppm. The 50 ppm signal is attributed to the methylene (CH₂) carbon directly bonded to the secondary amine in the tetrahydropyridine ring, where the deshielding effect of the nitrogen atom shifts the resonance downfield relative to typical aliphatic carbons. The 30 ppm peak corresponds to the remaining methylene carbons in the saturated portion of the bicyclic system, which experience a more shielded environment due to their distance from electronegative atoms. The spectrum lacks signals in the carbonyl (170–220 ppm) or highly deshielded sp²-hybridized regions (>160 ppm), confirming the absence of carbonyl groups or additional aromatic substituents. The integration of peak intensities aligns with the molecular symmetry, where equivalent carbons in the pyridine and tetrahydropyridine rings merge into single resonances. This pattern is consistent with the proposed bicyclic structure, where the fusion of a pyridine ring and a piperidine ring creates a rigid, planar aromatic system with a flexible saturated moiety. The observed chemical shifts and peak multiplicities provide strong evidence for the assigned molecular framework."

Key features include: 1. **Carbonyl region (170–200 ppm):** A prominent peak near 200 ppm corresponds to the two equivalent ketone carbonyl carbons (C=O) from the acetyl groups. A slightly lower-intensity peak around 175 ppm likely arises from the ester or ketone carbonyl adjacent to the oxygenated aliphatic chain. 2. **Aromatic region (100–150 ppm):** Multiple peaks between 120–150 ppm reflect the substituted aromatic rings. The fluorine substituent on one ring deshields adjacent carbons, shifting them downfield (150–160 ppm), while bromine induces moderate deshielding on its ortho/para carbons. The ether-linked aromatic carbons (attached to -O-) appear near 150 ppm due to electron-withdrawing effects. 3. **Aliphatic region (0–50 ppm):** Peaks around 30–40 ppm correspond to the methyl groups (CH3) in the acetyl and central ketone moieties. A distinct peak near 20 ppm may represent the methylene (CH2) group adjacent to the oxygen in the aliphatic chain. 4. **Oxygenated carbons:** The carbon bonded to the ether oxygen (-CH-O-) appears around 60–70 ppm, though this region overlaps with other aliphatic signals. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s asymmetry, with 20 distinct carbon environments. Fluorine’s strong electronegativity and bromine’s heavy atom effects contribute to the observed chemical shift dispersion. Integration and multiplicity analysis would further resolve overlapping signals, but the distribution aligns with the proposed structure."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at ~190 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ketone group, which is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen atom. This is consistent with the ketone functionality in the structure (C(=O)c2c[nH]c3ccccc23). Aromatic carbons dominate the region between 100–160 ppm. The indole moiety (c2c[nH]c3ccccc23) contributes peaks in the 100–130 ppm range, with the pyrrole ring carbons appearing at lower shifts (~100–120 ppm) due to their electron-rich environment. The benzene ring of the indole and the substituted pyridine ring (c2ccc(C)nc2) generate signals in the 120–160 ppm range.

The methyl group on the pyridine ring (c2ccc(C)nc2) appears as a small peak near ~20 ppm, typical for alkyl substituents on aromatic systems. The spectrum’s complexity arises from the molecule’s multiple aromatic rings and functional groups, each contributing to overlapping but distinguishable resonances. The absence of peaks below 0 ppm or above 200 ppm confirms the absence of highly shielded or strongly deshielded carbons outside the expected range for this structure. Overall, the chemical shifts align with the molecular features of C24H23N3O3, including the indole, pyridine, ketone, methoxy, and amine-linked methine groups."

The spectrum displays a molecular ion peak at m/z 236, corresponding to the intact molecule. The base peak at m/z 125 indicates a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the bond between the p-chlorophenyl group and the adjacent carbon in the pyrrolidine ring, generating a p-chlorobenzyl cation (C7H5Cl⁺). This fragment is stabilized by resonance within the aromatic ring and the inductive effect of the chlorine substituent. Additional significant peaks include m/z 91, characteristic of the tropylium ion (C7H7⁺), which forms via further fragmentation of the aromatic moiety, possibly through loss of the chlorine atom or rearrangement. The peak at m/z 117 may represent a fragment retaining the nitrogen and cyclopropyl group, such as C7H8NCl⁺, formed by cleavage of the pyrrolidine ring. Peaks at m/z 131, 139, and 141 suggest successive losses of small neutral fragments (e.g., CH2 or HCl) from larger intermediates. The presence of chlorine is corroborated by isotope peaks, such as m/z 220 and 222 (M-16 and M-14), which exhibit a ~3:1 intensity ratio consistent with ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl contributions. Other fragments, including m/z 165, 184, and 191, likely originate from complex ring-opening processes or loss of the cyclopropyl group (C3H5, 41 Da). The spectrum reflects typical fragmentation patterns for amines, including α-cleavage adjacent to the nitrogen and degradation of the pyrrolidine ring.

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks that correlate with the structural features of the compound. The most prominent signal appears as a sharp singlet at approximately 4.0 ppm, which is characteristic of a proton in a deshielded environment, likely the imine proton (C=N–H) adjacent to the electron-withdrawing dimethylamino group. This proton experiences significant downfield shift due to the conjugation and electronegativity of the surrounding nitrogen atoms. A second notable singlet is observed at ~2.5 ppm, corresponding to the six equivalent protons of the dimethylamino group (N(CH₃)₂). This signal is slightly upfield of the imine proton, consistent with the shielding effect of the methyl groups attached to nitrogen. The cyclohexyl ring (C2CCCCC2) contributes to a series of overlapping multiplets in the 1.0–2.0 ppm region, reflecting the complex splitting patterns of its methylene protons. These protons are in a relatively shielded environment due to the aliphatic nature of the ring. Additional minor peaks at ~3.0 ppm and ~1.5 ppm may arise from residual solvent (e.g., chloroform-d or DMSO-d6) or trace impurities, as they do not align with the expected chemical shifts of the target molecule. The absence of signals in the 7.0–9.0 ppm range suggests that aromatic protons on the pyridine ring (nc1ccc(C#N)c(N=CN(CH₃)₂)c1) are either not resolved in this spectral window or are suppressed due to rapid exchange or low concentration. The cyano group (C#N) does not contribute to the H-NMR spectrum, as it lacks protons. Overall, the spectrum highlights the key functional groups: the imine proton, dimethylamino group, and cyclohexyl ring, with chemical shifts and splitting patterns consistent with the proposed structure. The integration of peak intensities (not shown here) would further confirm the relative number of protons in each environment."

Key features include distinct cross-peaks in the aromatic region, aliphatic region, and heteroatom-adjacent environments. In the aromatic region, three prominent cross-peaks are observed: one near (δH 7.2 ppm, δC 130 ppm), another at (δH 6.9 ppm, δC 115 ppm), and a third at (δH 6.7 ppm, δC 125 ppm).

The spectrum also reveals a low-intensity peak at (δH 5.5 ppm, δC 150 ppm), likely corresponding to the carbon bearing the bromine atom. This carbon’s chemical shift is consistent with its electron-withdrawing effect. The absence of peaks in the carbonyl region (δC 170–220 ppm) confirms the lack of ketone or carboxylic acid functionalities. Overall, the HSQC spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, validating the connectivity of the aromatic ring, methyl group, and morpholine-like moiety. The observed chemical shifts and coupling patterns provide a comprehensive view of the molecule’s proton-carbon framework, essential for structural elucidation."

The spectrum exhibits a molecular ion peak at m/z 430, corresponding to the intact molecule. The base peak at m/z 388 indicates a highly stable fragment formed via loss of 42 Da, likely due to cleavage of the isopropyl group (C3H6) from the amide moiety. Additional prominent peaks include m/z 372 (loss of 58 Da, possibly C3H6 + CO), m/z 344 (loss of 86 Da, consistent with acetate ester fragmentation), and m/z 316 (loss of 114 Da, suggesting combined ester and amide bond cleavage). Peaks at m/z 282, 213, and 196 correspond to further degradation of the aromatic core, retaining chlorine substituents. The presence of chlorine atoms is evidenced by isotope patterns, with m/z 388 accompanied by characteristic +2 and +4 satellites (e.g., 390, 392) due to ³⁷Cl contributions. Lower-mass fragments (e.g., m/z 143) likely arise from cleavage of the ether linkage between the two aromatic rings. The spectrum reflects the compound's structural complexity, with fragmentation pathways dominated by ester, amide, and aryl-Cl bond labilities."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C12H8ClNO3S (SMILES: O=[N+]([O-])c1ccc(Cl)c(S(=O)c2ccccc2)c1). The spectrum displays four distinct cross-peaks in the aromatic region, consistent with the presence of eight protons and twelve carbons in the molecular structure. The ¹H chemical shifts range from 7.5 to 8.5 ppm, while the corresponding ¹³C shifts appear between 120 and 140 ppm. These values align with the expected aromatic proton and carbon environments in a disubstituted benzene ring system. The most downfield ¹H peak at ~8.3 ppm correlates with the carbon at ~140 ppm, likely corresponding to the proton adjacent to both the nitro (-NO₂) and sulfoxide (-SO-) groups, which exert strong deshielding effects. Two intermediate peaks (7.8–8.0 ppm / 128–132 ppm) represent protons on the phenyl ring attached to the sulfoxide group, while the upfield peak (~7.6 ppm / ~125 ppm) corresponds to the less electron-deficient aromatic protons. Notably, the absence of peaks outside the aromatic region confirms the lack of aliphatic or heteroatom-bound protons. The sulfoxide group's oxygen atom likely contributes to the moderate ¹³C shift dispersion, while the chlorine substituent enhances spin-spin coupling in adjacent nuclei. This HSQC spectrum effectively maps the direct proton-carbon connectivity in the aromatic framework, providing critical structural validation for the proposed molecular formula and connectivity."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the structure. The spectrum displays distinct cross-peaks distributed across the ¹H chemical shift range of 14 to -2 ppm and the ¹³C chemical shift range of 0 to 200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic region (¹H: 6–8 ppm; ¹³C: 100–150 ppm)**: Multiple cross-peaks are observed here, consistent with the aromatic protons and carbons in the dichlorinated benzimidazole moiety (n2c(NC3CC3)nc3cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc32). The presence of two chlorine substituents on the aromatic ring induces deshielding effects, shifting the adjacent protons and carbons to lower fields. 2. **Aliphatic region (¹H: 1–4 ppm; ¹³C: 20–70 ppm)**: Several cross-peaks in this region correspond to the cyclopropyl group (NC3CC3) and the hydroxyl-bearing carbons (C1, C3, and C4 in the central cyclohexane ring). The hydroxyl protons (O–H) may appear as broadened or absent peaks due to exchange effects, while the adjacent carbons (e.g., C1, C3, C4) show correlations with their attached protons. 3. **High-field region (¹H: <1 ppm; ¹³C: <20 ppm)**: A cross-peak near 0 ppm in the ¹H dimension and ~20 ppm in the ¹³C dimension likely corresponds to the methyl-like protons of the cyclopropyl group, which experience strong shielding. 4. **Carbonyl region (¹³C: 150–200 ppm)**: No significant cross-peaks are observed here, consistent with the absence of carbonyl groups in the SMILES structure. The spectrum reveals the connectivity between the benzimidazole aromatic system and the aliphatic hydroxylated cyclohexane ring, as well as the cyclopropylamine substituent. The chlorine atoms on the benzimidazole ring reduce electron density, causing downfield shifts in adjacent ¹H and ¹³C signals. The HSQC data, combined with the molecular formula and SMILES, confirm the presence of six protonated carbons: three in the aromatic system (two chlorinated), two in the cyclohexane ring (bearing hydroxyl groups), and one in the cyclopropyl group. This analysis aligns with the structural features of C16H19Cl2N3O3, providing a detailed view of its protonated carbon framework."

The spectrum displays characteristic absorption features corresponding to the functional groups present in this heterocyclic compound. In the region 3300–3100 cm⁻¹, sharp peaks are observed, which are consistent with aromatic C-H stretching vibrations from the thiophene and fluorinated phenyl rings. A prominent broad band near 1300–1100 cm⁻¹ arises from the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the sulfonyl (S(=O)₂) group, a key feature of the methylsulfonyl substituent. Additional strong absorptions near 1250–1000 cm⁻¹ likely correspond to C-F stretching vibrations from the para-fluorophenyl moiety, while peaks in the 900–700 cm⁻¹ range may reflect C-S stretching modes within the thiazole and thiophene rings. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) exhibits complex splitting patterns, indicative of coupled vibrations involving the aromatic systems, thioether linkages, and heterocyclic ring deformations. Notably, the absence of broad O-H or N-H stretches confirms the lack of hydroxyl or amine groups in the structure. The spectral profile aligns with the molecular architecture, where the sulfonyl group, fluorinated aromatic system, and sulfur-containing heterocycles dominate the IR-active vibrational modes. This analysis underscores the utility of IR spectroscopy in identifying functional group signatures within multifunctional organosulfur compounds."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at ~170 ppm is attributed to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the amide group, which is highly deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen and resonance effects. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the substituted benzene ring. The peak at ~150 ppm likely corresponds to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (C1), which is deshielded by the electron-withdrawing amide substituent. Peaks at ~130 ppm and ~120 ppm correspond to aromatic carbons ortho and meta to the substituents (Cl and I), respectively, while the peak at ~110 ppm may represent the carbon bonded to iodine (C4), as iodine’s heavy atom effect can induce significant shielding. The absence of distinct peaks in the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm) suggests that the cyclopropyl carbons (from the NC1CC1 group) are either overlapping with the baseline or obscured by solvent signals, though a minor peak at ~0 ppm could indicate residual solvent (e.g., TMS reference) or an artifact. The spectrum aligns with the expected structural features of the molecule, including the aromatic substitution pattern and the presence of electronegative halogens (Cl, I) that influence chemical shifts."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C13H9Cl2NO3 (SMILES: O=C(CNC(=O)c1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1)c1ccoc1). The spectrum displays several key features characteristic of this chlorinated aromatic compound. The molecular ion peak (M⁺) appears at m/z 298, corresponding to the exact mass of the intact molecule. This peak confirms the molecular weight and supports the proposed formula. A prominent base peak at m/z 173 (100% relative abundance) suggests a stable fragment ion, likely formed via cleavage of the amide bond (C–N) adjacent to the carbonyl group, yielding a fragment containing the dichlorophenyl and carbonyl moieties (C8H4Cl2NO⁺). The isotopic pattern at m/z 172, 173, and 174 reflects the presence of two chlorine atoms, with the 3:1 ratio of 172:174 peaks (due to ³⁵Cl/³⁷Cl isotopes) confirming the dichlorinated structure. Additional peaks at m/z 95 and 96 may arise from further fragmentation of the base peak, potentially losing the dichlorobenzoyl group to leave a furan-containing fragment (C4H3O⁺). Smaller peaks at m/z 145 and 147 also exhibit a chlorine isotopic pattern, suggesting a fragment retaining one chlorine atom, possibly from cleavage of the furan ring or rearrangement. Other notable features include low-abundance peaks at m/z 204, 230, and 280, which may correspond to less stable fragment ions or adducts. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 298 indicates minimal dimerization or aggregation. The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the structure, where labile bonds near the amide and carbonyl groups facilitate predictable cleavage. This spectrum provides critical insights into the compound’s structural integrity and fragmentation behavior under electron ionization, consistent with its chlorinated aromatic and heterocyclic components."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the aromatic, aliphatic, and functional group protons of the molecule. The most downfield signals (leftmost region) appear between 7.0–7.5 ppm, consistent with aromatic protons. These peaks arise from the two phenyl rings in the structure: one substituted with a methyl ester (-COOCH3) and a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3), and the other bearing a hydroxyl (-OH) substituent. The splitting patterns and integration suggest a combination of ortho- and meta-coupled protons, typical of substituted benzene rings. A sharp singlet at ~3.9 ppm corresponds to the three protons of the methyl ester (-OCH3) group, which is deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl oxygen. The tert-butyl group produces a prominent singlet at ~1.3 ppm, integrating to nine protons, characteristic of its symmetric, highly shielded environment. A broad, less intense peak near 6.5 ppm likely represents the hydroxyl proton (-OH) of the phenolic group, though its exact position may vary due to hydrogen bonding or solvent effects. The absence of signals in the aliphatic region (e.g., 1–3 ppm) beyond the tert-butyl and ester methyl groups aligns with the molecule’s structure, which lacks additional aliphatic chains. The integration ratios (3H for -OCH3, 9H for -C(CH3)3, and 7H for aromatic protons) confirm the molecular formula. The spectrum’s high-resolution peaks indicate a pure sample, with no significant impurities or overlapping signals. This H-NMR data provides clear evidence for the proposed structure, correlating chemical shifts and splitting patterns with the functional groups and substitution pattern of the aromatic rings."

The molecular ion [M+H]+ is observed at m/z 473, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the compound (472.93 g/mol). A significant peak at m/z 455 corresponds to the loss of water (18 Da), indicating the presence of a hydroxyl group on the piperidine ring, which undergoes dehydration during ionization. Additional fragment ions at m/z 294 and 295 suggest further breakdown of the molecular framework, potentially involving the loss of the fluorinated ethyl side chain (CCF) or the piperidine ring.

A prominent, sharp peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the ester moiety (COC(=O)). The ester group also contributes to multiple strong absorptions in the 1200–1300 cm⁻¹ region, corresponding to C-O and C-C stretches. The spectrum displays a series of sharp peaks between 2800–3000 cm⁻¹, attributable to aliphatic C-H stretching vibrations from the tert-butyl group (OC(C)(C)C) and methyl substituents on the heterocyclic rings. Aromatic C-H stretches from the substituted benzene ring (c1ccc(Cl)cc1F) appear as weaker peaks near 3050–3100 cm⁻¹. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) contains complex, overlapping peaks, including C-C ring vibrations, C-S stretches (from the thioether group in the bicyclic system), and C-Cl/C-F stretches, which are typically observed as medium-to-weak absorptions in this range. Notably, the absence of broad N-H stretches (~3300–3500 cm⁻¹) aligns with the lack of amine or amide groups in the structure.

The most prominent peak appears at approximately 6.5 ppm, which is characteristic of a proton adjacent to two electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups, likely the central CH group in the structure. A sharp peak at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene protons (-CH2Cl) attached to the aromatic ring, deshielded by the electronegative chlorine atom. The aromatic protons of the para-substituted benzene ring generate a multiplet around 7.5 ppm, consistent with their typical chemical shift range.

The spectrum displays correlations between directly bonded $^1$H and $^{13}$C nuclei, providing insights into the molecule's structural features. Key observations include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6.5–8.5 ppm, $^1$H; 120–140 ppm, $^{13}$C):** Multiple peaks in this region correspond to protons and carbons in the two phenyl rings. The trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl ring (c2cccc(C(F)(F)F)c2) exhibits deshielded protons (7.5–8.0 ppm) due to the electron-withdrawing CF₃ group, with attached carbons resonating near 125–135 ppm. The cyano-substituted phenyl ring (c1ccc(C#N)cc1) shows similar aromatic correlations, with ortho/para protons to the C#N group shifted downfield (7.8–8.5 ppm) owing to the nitrile's strong electron-withdrawing effect. 2. **Aliphatic Region (1–4 ppm, $^1$H; 10–60 ppm, $^{13}$C):** - **Ethoxy Groups (OCH₂CH₃):** Peaks near 4.0 ppm ($^1$H) and 55–60 ppm ($^{13}$C) arise from the methylene (CH₂) protons and carbons adjacent to oxygen in the phosphonate ester groups. The methyl (CH₃) groups of the ethoxy substituents appear at ~1.2 ppm ($^1$H) and ~15 ppm ($^{13}$C). - **Ring Methyl Group (C=C(C)):** A correlation at ~2.2 ppm ($^1$H) and ~20 ppm ($^{13}$C) corresponds to the methyl group attached to the sp²-hybridized carbon in the central heterocyclic ring. 3. **High-Field $^{13}$C Shifts (100–150 ppm):** Peaks near 130–150 ppm ($^{13}$C) with associated protons at 6.0–7.0 ppm ($^1$H) likely originate from sp² carbons in the heterocyclic core, including the carbon adjacent to the amide carbonyl (C=O) and the ring junction carbon bonded to the cyano-substituted phenyl group. 4. **Absence of Quaternary Carbon Signals:** Carbons without directly attached protons (e.g., the carbonyl carbon in the amide, the CF₃-substituted aromatic carbon, and the cyano carbon) do not produce peaks in this HSQC spectrum, as expected. The spectrum confirms the presence of distinct functional groups (phosphonate esters, CF₃, C#N, amide) and their connectivity, aligning with the provided molecular structure. The electron-withdrawing substituents (CF₃, C#N) significantly influence the chemical shifts of nearby protons and carbons, as evidenced by the deshielded aromatic resonances. This analysis underscores the utility of HSQC in mapping proton-carbon correlations to elucidate molecular frameworks."

Notably, the chlorine isotopic signature (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl) is evident in fragments retaining the chlorine atom, such as m/z 155 (³⁵Cl) and m/z 157 (³⁷Cl), though the latter is less prominent in this spectrum. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 282 confirms the molecular ion as the highest mass species. These fragmentation patterns align with the structure of 3-iodo-4-chlorobenzamide, where the amide group and halogen substituents dictate the observed mass spectral behavior. The spectrum effectively highlights the molecular integrity and characteristic decomposition pathways of this compound."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C16H21NO3 (SMILES: Cc1ccc(C(=O)NCCC2CCCC2)cc1C(=O)O). The spectrum displays characteristic peaks corresponding to the structural features of the molecule. A prominent singlet at ~12.0 ppm is attributed to the carboxylic acid proton (–COOH), which typically appears as a broad or downfield-shifted signal due to hydrogen bonding and deshielding effects. The aromatic region (6.5–8.0 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks, reflecting the substituted benzene ring. Specifically, the peaks at ~7.8 ppm and ~7.2 ppm likely correspond to the aromatic protons ortho and meta to the electron-withdrawing amide carbonyl group (–CONH–), which deshields nearby protons. The methyl group (–CH3) attached to the benzene ring appears as a singlet at ~2.3 ppm, consistent with its electron-donating nature and proximity to the aromatic system. A triplet at ~3.5 ppm and a quartet at ~4.0 ppm are indicative of the –CH2– groups in the N-ethylcyclopentyl substituent. The triplet (~3.5 ppm) arises from the methylene protons adjacent to the amide nitrogen (–NH–CH2–), while the quartet (~4.0 ppm) corresponds to the methylene protons adjacent to the carbonyl group (–CO–CH2–), both split by neighboring protons. The cyclopentyl ring protons generate a complex multiplet in the 1.0–2.0 ppm range, overlapping with the methyl group signal. This region reflects the magnetically distinct environments of the cyclopentane ring due to its non-planar conformation. The absence of signals above 10 ppm (other than the carboxylic acid) suggests no additional exchangeable protons (e.g., hydroxyl or secondary amine groups). The integration ratios and splitting patterns align with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of 16 carbons, 21 hydrogens, and 3 heteroatoms (N, O). Overall, the spectrum provides clear evidence of the aromatic, aliphatic, and functional group environments in Cc1ccc(C(=O)NCCC2CCCC2)cc1C(=O)O."

The spectrum exhibits distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–12 ppm, reflecting the diverse proton environments in this heterocyclic compound. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at 6.0 ppm with the highest intensity, likely corresponding to the aromatic protons of the benzene and triazole rings. This region typically accommodates protons on electron-deficient aromatic systems, consistent with the thioether-linked benzene rings and the triazole-pyridine fused system in the structure. A high-field singlet at 12.0 ppm is indicative of the primary amine (–NH₂) group, which often appears as a broad or deshielded peak due to hydrogen bonding. Adjacent to this, a smaller peak at 10.5 ppm likely represents the amide (–NH–) proton, which is strongly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl group. The presence of these two distinct downfield signals confirms the molecule’s functional groups. In the aliphatic region (0–3 ppm), two overlapping peaks at 2.2 and 2.5 ppm suggest the cyclopropane ring protons (C4CC4). Cyclopropane protons typically appear upfield due to their saturated nature, but their proximity to the electron-withdrawing amide group may slightly deshield them. The splitting pattern here implies non-equivalent proton environments within the strained three-membered ring. Additional aromatic signals are observed at 7.5 and 8.0 ppm, which may correspond to protons on the triazole or pyridine-like rings, where deshielding effects from nitrogen atoms shift resonances downfield. The absence of peaks below 0 ppm and the lack of broad water signals suggest a dry, well-dissolved sample in a deuterated solvent. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, revealing key features of aromaticity, hydrogen bonding, and aliphatic strain. Integration and coupling patterns would further clarify proton counts and connectivity, but the current data strongly support the assigned molecular framework."

The spectrum exhibits several diagnostic peaks characteristic of its functional groups. A sharp, intense absorption at ~2220 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the nitrile (C≡N) stretch, confirming the presence of the cyano group in the structure. Broad, moderate peaks near 3400 cm⁻¹ are attributed to N–H stretching vibrations from the secondary amine (–NH–) linkage between the aromatic rings. The absence of a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak near 1700 cm⁻¹ aligns with the molecular structure, which lacks ketone or ester functionalities. Aromatic C–H stretching vibrations are evident as sharp peaks between 3000–3100 cm⁻¹, consistent with the polycyclic aromatic system. Multiple medium-to-strong absorptions in the 1600–1500 cm⁻¹ range reflect C=C and C=N stretches within the conjugated aromatic framework, including the quinoline and substituted benzene rings. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex patterns, including C–F stretching near 1100–1200 cm⁻¹ (from the fluorine substituent) and C–Cl vibrations near 500–600 cm⁻¹, though these are less distinct due to overlapping peaks. The methoxy groups (–OCH₃) contribute to peaks near 1250 cm⁻¹ (C–O stretch) and 2850–2950 cm⁻¹ (C–H stretches of methyl). Overall, the IR spectrum corroborates the proposed structure, highlighting the nitrile, aromaticity, amine linkage, and halogen substituents without evidence of extraneous functional groups."

The spectrum displays several distinct chemical shifts corresponding to the protons in different electronic environments of the molecule. The most prominent feature is a sharp, high-intensity singlet at 2.0 ppm, which likely corresponds to the nine equivalent protons of the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) attached to the carbamate nitrogen. This group is shielded due to its aliphatic nature and lack of conjugation, resulting in a downfield shift typical for such substituents. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.0 ppm), multiple smaller peaks are observed, consistent with the presence of two substituted phenyl rings. These signals likely arise from the protons on the benzene rings connected via the ethylene glycol linker (OCH2CH2O). The splitting patterns and integration suggest a combination of ortho- and para-substituted aromatic systems, with each ring contributing distinct doublets or multiplets due to the symmetry of the substituents. A notable singlet at 10.0 ppm is observed, which can be attributed to the deshielded NH proton of the thiazolidine-2,4-dione ring (S-C(=O)-NH-C(=O)). This proton experiences strong deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl groups and the sulfur atom. Additionally, a small peak near 4.0 ppm may correspond to the methylene protons (CH2) of the ethylene glycol linker, which are deshielded by proximity to the oxygen atoms. The spectrum also shows minor peaks around 6.0–7.0 ppm, potentially representing the NH proton of the carbamate group (NH-C(=O)-O) or additional aromatic protons. The absence of signals in the 9–10 ppm range (other than the thiazolidine NH) confirms the lack of aldehyde or strongly hydrogen-bonded protons. The overall chemical shift distribution aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the tert-butyl group, aromatic systems, ethylene glycol bridge, and thiazolidine-2,4-dione core. This H-NMR spectrum provides clear evidence of the molecule’s structural integrity and the electronic environments of its hydrogen atoms."

The spectrum displays characteristic proton resonances corresponding to the structural features of the compound. The most prominent peak at ~12 ppm (singlet) is attributed to the amide proton (CONH), which is deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. A series of aromatic protons appear between 8–10 ppm, with the doublet at ~8.5 ppm likely corresponding to the pyrimidine ring protons (H-2 and H-4) adjacent to the electron-deficient nitrogen atoms. The multiplet near 7.5–8 ppm integrates to four protons, consistent with the substituted phenyl ring (C6H3ClF) and its coupling patterns. The singlet at ~4 ppm (intensity ~0.1) corresponds to the methylene protons (CH2) of the piperidine ring adjacent to the amide nitrogen, experiencing moderate deshielding. A broad multiplet at ~3 ppm (intensity ~0.15) arises from the N-methyl groups (N(CH3)) and the methoxy group (OCH3) on the quinazoline ring, which overlap due to similar chemical environments. The triplet at ~2 ppm (intensity ~0.1) is assigned to the ethylene bridge (CH2CH2) in the piperidine ring, showing coupling with adjacent protons. Notably, the absence of peaks below 2 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic protons beyond the piperidine ring. The integration ratios align with the molecular structure, with aromatic protons dominating the high-field region and aliphatic protons concentrated in the low-field region. The spectrum reflects the compound’s asymmetry, with distinct splitting patterns for protons in different electronic environments. The presence of Cl and F substituents on the aromatic ring is evidenced by the downfield shift of adjacent protons due to their electronegativity. Overall, the H-NMR spectrum provides clear evidence of the compound’s functional groups and connectivity as described by the SMILES notation."

Key features include: 1. **Aliphatic Region (1-2 ppm, 20-40 ppm):** - A prominent cross-peak at ~1.4 ppm (¹H) and ~28 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the tert-butyl group (C(CH₃)₃) of the carbamate moiety. The equivalent methyl protons exhibit a singlet due to symmetry, while the quaternary carbon appears as a single resonance. - Peaks near ~1.8-2.2 ppm (¹H) and ~25-35 ppm (¹³C) arise from methylene (CH₂) groups in the piperidine ring. These protons are slightly deshielded due to proximity to the nitrogen and fluorine substituent. 2. **Fluorinated Carbon Region (~4.5 ppm, ~95 ppm):** - A distinct cross-peak at ~4.5 ppm (¹H) and ~95 ppm (¹³C) indicates a proton directly attached to a carbon bearing fluorine (CHF). The fluorine atom induces significant downfield shifts in both ¹H and ¹³C dimensions due to its high electronegativity and spin-spin coupling. 3. **Aromatic/Thiazole Region (7-8.5 ppm, 120-140 ppm):** - Two cross-peaks at ~7.2 ppm (¹H)/~120 ppm (¹³C) and ~8.5 ppm (¹H)/~140 ppm (¹³C) correspond to the thiazole ring protons and their directly bonded carbons. The thiazole’s aromatic system results in deshielded protons and carbons, with the nitrogen and sulfur atoms influencing the chemical shifts. 4. **Piperidine CH₂ Groups Adjacent to Nitrogen (~3.5 ppm, ~45 ppm):** - A cross-peak at ~3.5 ppm (¹H) and ~45 ppm (¹³C) is attributed to methylene protons (CH₂) adjacent to the carbamate nitrogen. These protons are deshielded by the electronegative nitrogen atom. The spectrum lacks signals in the carbonyl (160-180 ppm) and highly deshielded proton (10+ ppm) regions, consistent with the absence of acidic protons or conjugated carbonyl groups in the structure. The fluorine substitution on the piperidine ring introduces characteristic shifts and splitting patterns, while the thiazole ring’s aromaticity is reflected in its distinct chemical shifts. Overall, the HSQC data aligns with the proposed structure, confirming the connectivity of protons and carbons in the tert-butyl carbamate, fluorinated piperidine, and thiazole moieties."

This singlet integrates to five protons, consistent with the monosubstituted benzene ring in the benzyl ester group (OCc1ccccc1). The electron-withdrawing ester oxygen slightly deshields these protons, shifting them downfield compared to typical aromatic regions. A sharp singlet at 5.0 ppm (2H) corresponds to the benzyl methylene group (OCH2), adjacent to the electronegative oxygen atom. The ketal moiety (OCCO2) in the cyclohexane ring produces two overlapping multiplets near 4.0 ppm (4H), reflecting the diastereotopic protons of the ethylene glycol-derived ring. These protons are deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atoms. The ethyl group attached to the nitrogen (CCN) exhibits a quartet at 3.2 ppm (2H) and a triplet at 1.1 ppm (3H), typical for a CH2CH3 spin system. The quartet arises from coupling between the CH2 and CH3 groups, with the CH2 protons deshielded by the nearby nitrogen. The cyclohexane ring protons appear as complex multiplets between 1.0–2.0 ppm, reflecting their diverse chemical environments due to the rigid ring structure and substituents. A minor peak at 10.0 ppm is likely an artifact or impurity, as no protons in the molecule are expected in this region. The absence of signals above 10 ppm confirms the lack of acidic protons (e.g., carboxylic acids or aldehydes).

The spectrum displays distinct carbon environments across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, consistent with the structural complexity of the molecule. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic region (120–160 ppm):** Two prominent peaks near 150 ppm correspond to the thiophene ring carbons (C=C in the 's1' moiety), which are deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing sulfur atom. The substitution pattern on the thiophene (linked to a butyl chain and piperidine ring) creates distinct chemical environments for these carbons. 2. **Carbonyl region (160–200 ppm):** A sharp peak at ~195 ppm indicates the presence of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the hydroxamic acid group (C(=O)NO). This high-field shift is typical for carbonyl carbons adjacent to electronegative atoms (oxygen and nitrogen). 3. **Aliphatic region (0–60 ppm):** Multiple peaks between 20–60 ppm arise from saturated carbons in the butyl chain, piperidine ring (C2CCNCC2), and the ethylene glycol-derived CCOCC fragment. The peak near 40 ppm likely corresponds to the methylene carbons (CH2) adjacent to the sulfone group (S(=O)2), which are deshielded by the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl moiety. The terminal methyl group of the butyl chain appears as a low-intensity peak near 10 ppm. 4. **Sulfone-adjacent carbons:** The quaternary carbon bonded to the sulfone group (C3 in the SMILES) is expected to appear at ~60–70 ppm, though its exact position may overlap with other aliphatic signals. The spectrum reflects the molecule’s diverse functional groups: the thiophene ring, sulfonamide, hydroxamic acid, and multiple aliphatic chains. The absence of peaks above 200 ppm confirms no additional carbonyl or highly deshielded carbons are present. Integration of peak intensities would further clarify the ratio of equivalent carbons, though this is not provided here. Overall, the C-NMR data aligns well with the proposed structure, highlighting distinct chemical environments for each carbon type."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the unique carbon environments in p-trifluoromethylcinnamoyl chloride. The most downfield peak, observed near 190 ppm, arises from the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the acyl chloride group, which is strongly deshielded due to the electronegative chlorine and conjugation with the adjacent double bond. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks reflect the substituted benzene ring. The quaternary aromatic carbon bonded to the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) appears near 140–150 ppm, while the carbon attached to the ethenyl group (C=C) is similarly deshielded in this range. The remaining aromatic carbons, influenced by the electron-withdrawing CF3 and conjugated system, exhibit peaks between 120–135 ppm. The CF3 carbon itself typically resonates near 120–130 ppm, overlapping with some aromatic signals. The ethenyl carbons (C=C) show distinct shifts: the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (α-position) appears around 130–140 ppm due to conjugation, while the β-carbon bonded to the aromatic ring is slightly upfield (~120–130 ppm). The spectrum’s complexity in the 100–150 ppm region reflects the asymmetric substitution pattern of the aromatic ring, with the para-CF3 and ethenyl groups creating distinct electronic environments for each carbon. These features collectively confirm the structural motifs of the molecule, including the acyl chloride, conjugated double bond, and trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatic system."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule’s structural complexity. The most prominent peak, observed near 0 ppm, likely corresponds to the tert-butyl group of the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) moiety, which typically appears as a sharp singlet in this region due to its high symmetry and lack of proton coupling. Adjacent to this, a cluster of peaks between 20–40 ppm arises from aliphatic carbons in the bicyclic piperidine ring system, including methylene (CH₂) and bridgehead carbons, which experience shielding from their saturated environments. A notable resonance near 80 ppm is attributed to the carbonyl carbon of the Boc group, shifted downfield due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The aromatic region (100–160 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks, including a characteristic quartet near 120 ppm, indicative of the trifluoromethyl (CF₃) group. This splitting pattern arises from coupling with three equivalent fluorine atoms (¹⁹F-¹³C coupling). Additional aromatic carbons, including those adjacent to the fluorine substituent on the pyridine ring, appear as doublets or multiplets due to fluorine-carbon spin-spin interactions, reflecting the electron-withdrawing effects of the halogen. The spectrum also shows a low-intensity peak near 160 ppm, likely corresponding to the carbon directly bonded to the fluorine atom on the aromatic ring, which is strongly deshielded. Minor peaks in the 50–70 ppm range may originate from carbons bonded to nitrogen (e.g., the piperidine nitrogen-adjacent carbons), which experience intermediate shielding. The overall peak distribution aligns with the molecular framework, confirming the presence of the Boc-protected amine, fluorinated aromatic system, and bicyclic core. No significant impurities or artifacts are evident, aside from a residual solvent peak at 0 ppm (likely CDCl₃ or TMS reference). This C-NMR spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule’s carbon connectivity and electronic environment, supporting its structural assignment."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 261, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of the compound (260.21 g/mol). The base peak at m/z 162 (100% relative abundance) suggests a highly stable fragment, likely resulting from cleavage of the amide bond and loss of the trifluoroethylamine group (NCC(F)(F)F, 87 Da). This fragment may represent the benzoyl oxime cation (C8H7NO2+), which is stabilized by resonance within the aromatic ring and the oxime functional group. Additional significant peaks include m/z 105 and 106, which could arise from further fragmentation of the benzoyl oxime moiety, such as loss of the oxime group (C=NOH, 31 Da) or rearrangement within the aromatic ring. The peak at m/z 135 may correspond to the loss of the trifluoromethyl group (CF3, 69 Da) from the molecular ion, while m/z 131 could indicate a subsequent loss of a hydroxyl radical (•OH, 17 Da) from this fragment. Smaller peaks at m/z 89 and 153 may originate from cleavage of the methyl group (CH3, 15 Da) or partial decomposition of the oxime functionality. The presence of fluorine atoms is reflected in the absence of significant isotope peaks, as fluorine-19 is the only stable isotope and lacks natural isotopic splitting. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern is consistent with the structural features of the molecule, including the aromatic ring, oxime group, and trifluoroethyl substituent. These observations confirm the molecular identity and provide insights into the compound’s stability and fragmentation pathways under mass spectrometric conditions."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks characteristic of aromatic, aliphatic, and functional group protons. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at ~6.0 ppm, which corresponds to the aromatic protons of the methoxy-substituted benzene ring. The electron-donating methoxy group (OCH3) induces an upfield shift for these protons compared to typical aromatic regions (6.5–8.0 ppm). Adjacent to this, a cluster of smaller peaks between 7.0–8.0 ppm likely arises from the protons of the second benzene ring, which lacks electron-donating substituents and thus resonates at slightly higher frequency. A broad, moderately intense peak near ~2.5 ppm is attributed to the two methylene (CH2) groups flanking the carbonyl (C=O) moiety. These protons experience deshielding due to the adjacent electronegative carbonyl oxygen, placing them in the aliphatic region. A smaller singlet at ~3.5 ppm corresponds to the methoxy group’s three equivalent protons (OCH3). The chiral center’s α-proton (adjacent to the amine group) appears as a multiplet near ~3.0 ppm, influenced by coupling with neighboring protons. Notably, a sharp peak at ~10.0 ppm suggests the presence of an amine proton (NH2 or NH), though its exact position may vary due to hydrogen bonding or solvent effects. The absence of signals below 2.0 ppm indicates no significant aliphatic branching or isolated methyl groups. Integration ratios align with the molecular formula, confirming the presence of 21 protons distributed across aromatic, methoxy, methylene, and amine environments. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the compound’s structural motifs, including aromatic rings, a ketone, and an amine-functionalized chiral center."

The aliphatic C-H stretching vibrations appear as multiple sharp peaks between 2800–3000 cm⁻¹, consistent with the methyl and methylene groups in the structure. A prominent absorption near 1300–1350 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the asymmetric stretching of the sulfonamide S=O bonds, while a weaker band near 1100–1150 cm⁻¹ reflects symmetric S=O stretching. These features align with the -NSO₂CH₃ group in the molecule. The aromatic C=C stretching vibrations are observed as medium-intensity peaks in the 1450–1600 cm⁻¹ region, confirming the presence of the benzene ring. Additionally, a sharp peak near 1000–1050 cm⁻¹ may arise from C-N stretching in the amine or sulfonamide group. The thioether (C-S) bond is indicated by a moderate absorption near 600–700 cm⁻¹. Notably, the absence of a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of ketone or ester functionalities in the structure.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing insights into the molecule’s proton-carbon connectivity. The spectrum displays three distinct cross-peaks, each representing a unique CH environment in the structure. The most downfield cross-peak appears at approximately 11.5 ppm (¹H) and 150 ppm (¹³C). This corresponds to a proton attached to a carbon atom in an electron-deficient aromatic environment, likely adjacent to nitrogen or sulfur heteroatoms. In the given molecule, this feature is consistent with the proton on the thiazole ring (position 5 in the fused bicyclic system), where deshielding by the adjacent sulfur and nitrogen atoms elevates both chemical shifts. A second cross-peak is observed at ~10.2 ppm (¹H) and 130 ppm (¹³C). This intermediate shift suggests a proton on an aromatic carbon, possibly within the chlorinated benzene ring. The chlorine substituent exerts an inductive effect, deshielding the nearby proton and carbon. This peak likely corresponds to one of the meta- or para-substituted aromatic protons on the benzene moiety. The third cross-peak, at ~2.3 ppm (¹H) and 20 ppm (¹³C), is characteristic of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to an aromatic ring. The upfield position of both shifts reflects the electron-donating nature of the methyl group and its lack of direct attachment to electronegative atoms. This aligns with the methyl substituent on the benzene ring in the SMILES structure. The absence of additional peaks suggests that other protons (e.g., those on the pyrimidine ring or remaining aromatic positions) either overlap with the observed signals or are too broadened by relaxation effects to resolve. The spectrum confirms the presence of three distinct CH environments: a heteroaromatic CH, a chlorinated aromatic CH, and a methyl group. These observations are consistent with the molecular framework provided, where the fused thiazole-pyrimidine system and substituted benzene ring dominate the spectral features. The HSQC data thus validates key structural motifs, including the connectivity of the methyl group and the electronic influence of halogen and heteroatom substituents."

The spectrum exhibits distinct peaks corresponding to the unique chemical environments of hydrogen atoms in the molecule. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at ~12 ppm with high intensity, indicative of the sulfonamide (N-H) proton. This downfield shift is characteristic of the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the sulfonyl group (S=O), which deshields the attached nitrogen proton. Adjacent to this, a slightly less intense peak at ~11 ppm is observed, likely corresponding to the amide (N-H) proton of the carbonyl group.

Peaks at m/z 229 and 243 correspond to losses of CO2 (44 Da) and the trifluoromethyl group (CF3, 69 Da), respectively, from the molecular ion. Additional peaks at m/z 177, 191, and 271 reflect cleavage of the ether (C–O) and ester (C–O–C) bonds in the methoxy and carboxylic acid-containing side chain. The presence of fluorine is evidenced by isotope patterns, with minor peaks at m/z 207 and 214 corresponding to ¹³C or ¹⁸O isotopes. The fragmentation pattern aligns with the structure’s functional groups: the methoxy group (m/z 91, 107), acetyl moiety (m/z 119, 134), and the trifluoromethyl-bearing carboxylic acid side chain (m/z 199, 211). The spectrum confirms the molecular integrity of the compound and highlights key structural motifs through characteristic fragmentation."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C19H16N2O3 (SMILES: CNC(=O)Oc1ccc(N=Cc2ccccc2O)c2ccccc12). The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in this structurally complex molecule. The most downfield peak, observed near 170 ppm, corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the carbamate functional group, which is highly deshielded due to the electronegativity of the adjacent oxygen and nitrogen atoms. A prominent peak around 160 ppm is attributed to the imine carbon (C=N), which is also deshielded by the electron-withdrawing nitrogen atom. Additional peaks in the 140–150 ppm range arise from aromatic carbons directly bonded to electronegative substituents, such as the oxygen in the phenolic –OH group and the carbamate oxygen attached to the naphthalene ring. The aromatic region (100–140 ppm) exhibits multiple well-resolved peaks, indicative of the naphthalene core and the substituted benzene ring. These signals reflect the non-equivalent carbon environments within the fused-ring system and the influence of substituents on electron density. For example, carbons adjacent to the phenolic hydroxyl group experience deshielding, shifting their signals downfield compared to unsubstituted aromatic carbons. The peak near 30 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (N–CH3) attached to the carbamate nitrogen, which appears upfield due to its aliphatic nature and lack of conjugation. The absence of signals below 20 ppm confirms there are no additional aliphatic or sp³-hybridized carbons beyond the methyl group. The spectrum’s complexity in the aromatic region aligns with the molecule’s asymmetry, as the naphthalene and benzene rings bear distinct substituents that disrupt symmetry and create unique chemical environments for each carbon. Overall, the observed chemical shifts and peak multiplicities are consistent with the molecular structure derived from the provided SMILES notation, validating the presence of the carbamate, imine, phenolic, and naphthalene moieties."

The spectrum displays characteristic peaks corresponding to the structural features of the compound. The most prominent signal at ~1.5 ppm (singlet) arises from the methyl groups of the isopropyl ester moiety (OCH(CH3)2), which are equivalent and appear as a single resonance. A distinct septet at ~4.2 ppm corresponds to the methine proton (CH) of the isopropyl group, split by coupling with the six equivalent methyl protons. The N-methyl group of the amide (N-CH3) likely contributes a singlet near ~2.8–3.2 ppm, though it may overlap with other aliphatic signals. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed due to the complex splitting patterns of the fluorinated benzamide and benzoxazole rings. The fluorine substituent on the benzamide ring induces a strong deshielding effect, causing the ortho- and para-protons to resonate downfield (~7.8–8.2 ppm) as doublets or multiplets due to ³JHF and ⁴JHF couplings. The benzoxazole ring protons (positions 5 and 6) appear as doublets in the ~7.2–7.6 ppm range, influenced by the electron-withdrawing oxygen and nitrogen atoms. A sharp singlet at ~10 ppm is attributed to the amide proton (N-H), though its high chemical shift suggests significant deshielding, possibly due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding or ring-current effects from adjacent aromatic systems. The piperidine ring protons (C4CCNCC4) generate multiplets in the ~1.8–3.5 ppm region, with the N-CH2 groups appearing slightly upfield (~2.5–3.0 ppm) due to their proximity to the nitrogen. The carbonyl groups (amide and carbonate) lack direct proton signals but influence neighboring protons through inductive effects. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected proton environments of the molecule, reflecting its aromaticity, heterocyclic components, and aliphatic substituents."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances consistent with the structural features of the compound. In the aromatic region (120–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the two substituted benzene rings. The tert-butyl-substituted aromatic ring (c1ccc(CN...)cc1) likely contributes to signals near 140–150 ppm, corresponding to the quaternary carbon attached to the tert-butyl group and the para-substituted aromatic carbons. Additional aromatic peaks in the 125–135 ppm range arise from the chlorinated ring (c2cc(Cl)cc(C3CC3)c2), with the chlorine atom inducing deshielding effects on adjacent carbons. A prominent peak near 50 ppm corresponds to the methylene carbon (CH2) directly bonded to the nitrogen atom in the ethylamine linker (CNCCc2...), which is deshielded due to the electronegative nitrogen. Adjacent methylene groups (CH2CH2) in the linker appear as weaker signals in the 20–35 ppm range. The tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) generates a strong, sharp peak at ~30 ppm, characteristic of its three equivalent methyl carbons. The cyclopropyl moiety (C3CC3) is evident in the upfield region (10–20 ppm), with its unique ring strain causing distinct chemical shifts. A minor peak near 10 ppm may correspond to the cyclopropyl carbons, while another signal at ~20 ppm could represent the methylene bridge (CH2) adjacent to the cyclopropyl-substituted aromatic ring. Notably, the absence of signals above 160 ppm confirms no carbonyl or highly deshielded aromatic carbons are present, aligning with the absence of electron-withdrawing groups beyond chlorine. The spectrum’s peak distribution and intensities correlate well with the molecular symmetry and substitution pattern, particularly the tert-butyl and cyclopropyl groups, which reduce the number of unique carbon environments. This analysis underscores the utility of C-NMR in resolving structural motifs through characteristic chemical shift ranges and peak multiplicities."

The spectrum displays characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups in this structure. A broad, moderate-intensity peak near 3500 cm⁻¹ is consistent with N–H stretching vibrations from the secondary amine in the piperazine ring (N2CCN). Sharp peaks around 3000 cm⁻¹ arise from aromatic and aliphatic C–H stretching vibrations, reflecting the molecule’s multiple methyl groups (e.g., c3c(C)c(C)) and aromatic rings. The absence of a strong, broad absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of carbonyl (C=O) functionality, aligning with the molecular formula. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), intense peaks near 1500 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ correspond to aromatic C=C stretching modes from the substituted benzene rings (e.g., c1ccc(C)cc1).

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks that correlate with the molecular structure. The most prominent peak at approximately 8.5 ppm corresponds to the proton on the 1,2,4-triazine ring adjacent to the amino group (-NH2). This high chemical shift reflects the deshielding effect of the electron-withdrawing nitrogen atoms in the triazine ring.

    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C14H9F3O (SMILES: O=Cc1ccc(-c2ccccc2C(F)(F)F)cc1). The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups in the molecule. A sharp, intense peak at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the stretching vibration of the carbonyl group (C=O) in the aldehyde moiety. This absorption is slightly shifted to lower wavenumbers compared to a typical aldehyde C=O stretch (usually ~1725 cm⁻¹), likely due to conjugation with the adjacent aromatic ring, which delocalizes the electron density and weakens the bond. A moderate peak near 2700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the aldehyde C-H stretching vibration, a hallmark of aldehydes, often appearing as a weaker absorption compared to the C=O band. The aromatic C-H stretching vibrations are observed in the region 3000–3100 cm⁻¹, with multiple sharp peaks indicating the presence of substituted benzene rings. A prominent absorption band near 1100 cm⁻¹ is consistent with the strong C-F stretching vibrations of the trifluoromethyl (-CF₃) group, which typically appears as a broad, intense peak in this region due to the high bond strength and polarity of C-F bonds. Additionally, weaker absorptions in the 1450–1600 cm⁻¹ range correspond to the C=C stretching vibrations of the aromatic rings, further confirming the aromatic character of the molecule.

The overall spectral features—aldehyde C=O and C-H stretches, aromatic C-H and C=C bands, and the distinctive C-F absorption—provide strong evidence for the molecular structure of 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzaldehyde (C14H9F3O). The spectrum effectively highlights the interplay between functional group vibrations and molecular symmetry in determining infrared absorption patterns."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in this chiral benzofuran derivative. The most prominent features include a cluster of intense peaks between 110–150 ppm, corresponding to aromatic carbons in the two substituted benzene rings. The peak near 150 ppm is characteristic of phenolic carbons (C–OH), while the signals at 110–130 ppm arise from unsubstituted aromatic carbons. A sharp resonance at ~100 ppm likely corresponds to the benzofuran ring carbon bonded to the oxygen atom (C–O), which is deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen. In the aliphatic region (0–60 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, including a notable signal near 50 ppm. This downfield shift is consistent with the fluorine-substituted carbon in the cyclopentane ring, as fluorine’s high electronegativity induces significant deshielding. Adjacent aliphatic carbons in the saturated ring system appear as weaker resonances between 20–40 ppm. The absence of signals above 170 ppm confirms the lack of carbonyl groups, aligning with the structure’s hydroxyl and ether functionalities. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s stereochemistry, with diastereotopic carbons in the fused cyclopentane ring contributing to the multiplicity of peaks. Overall, the chemical shifts and peak intensities are consistent with the proposed structure, providing clear evidence for the aromatic, heterocyclic, and fluorinated aliphatic components of this compound."

    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C15H16ClNS (SMILES: CN1CCc2c(Cl)csc2C(c2ccccc2)C1). The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands that correlate with the functional groups and structural features of the molecule. A prominent peak near 3400 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of N–H stretching vibrations, though the tertiary amine in the structure (CN1) typically lacks an N–H bond. This peak may instead arise from trace moisture or impurities, as the molecule’s SMILES does not include a protonated nitrogen. Sharp absorptions around 3000–2850 cm⁻¹ correspond to aliphatic C–H stretching vibrations from the saturated carbons in the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring system. A distinct band near 1600 cm⁻¹ is consistent with aromatic C=C stretching from the benzene ring and thiophene moiety. Additional peaks in the 1500–1400 cm⁻¹ region likely reflect C–N stretching vibrations from the tertiary amine and possible C=C deformations in the aromatic systems. A strong absorption near 1000 cm⁻¹ may be attributed to C–S stretching from the thioether group in the thiophene ring. The sharp peak at ~700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of C–Cl stretching, directly correlating with the chlorine substituent on the thiophene ring. The complex fingerprint region below 1500 cm⁻¹ contains overlapping bands from C–H in-plane bending, ring deformations, and other skeletal vibrations, which are typical for polycyclic structures. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the molecular framework of a chlorinated thioether-containing tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative, though the N–H peak warrants further investigation for potential sample handling artifacts."

The spectrum displays correlations between 1H and 13C nuclei, with 1H chemical shifts (ppm) on the x-axis and 13C chemical shifts (ppm) on the y-axis. Key features include: (1) Aromatic regions: Peaks cluster between 6.5–8.5 ppm (1H) and 110–140 ppm (13C), consistent with the indole, pyridine, and chlorinated benzene rings in the structure. The indole NH (expected ~8–10 ppm in 1H) likely corresponds to a downfield 1H signal near 8 ppm with a 13C shift ~120 ppm, reflecting the electron-rich aromatic environment. (2) Aliphatic regions: A distinct peak at ~4.2 ppm (1H) and ~63 ppm (13C) matches the OCH2 group of the ethyl ester, while methyl groups (e.g., pyridine-CH3, benzene-CH3) appear as peaks near 2.2–2.5 ppm (1H) and 20–25 ppm (13C). (3) Oxygenated carbons: The ethyl ester’s CH2O group (CCCO-) is evident at ~3.9 ppm (1H) and ~67 ppm (13C), showing coupling to the adjacent CH3. (4) Chlorine effects: The chlorinated benzene ring exhibits deshielded 1H shifts (~7.2–7.5 ppm) and 13C shifts (~130–140 ppm) due to the electron-withdrawing Cl substituent. Notably, the absence of peaks >160 ppm (13C) suggests no quaternary carbonyl or highly deshielded aromatic carbons are directly protonated. This HSQC spectrum effectively maps the molecule’s protonated carbons, enabling structural validation and assignment of key functional groups."

The base peak at m/z 218 confirms the molecular ion (M⁺) as the most abundant species, indicating high stability of the parent structure under the ionization conditions. Key fragment ions are observed at m/z 191, 192, 178, 174, 151, 138, 137, 123, and 107. The peak at m/z 191 (M−27) suggests loss of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a common fragmentation pathway for nitrile-containing compounds. The adjacent peak at m/z 192 (M−26) may arise from the loss of a neutral CN radical, further supporting the presence of the nitrile group (N#C−) in the structure. The ions at m/z 178 (M−40) and 174 (M−44) likely correspond to the elimination of small neutral fragments such as C₃H₄ (allene or cyclopropene) and CO₂, respectively. These losses may involve rearrangements or cleavage of the butyl chain linking the nitrile to the benzothiazole ring. The peaks at m/z 138 and 137 (M−80 and M−81) are consistent with the retention of the benzothiazole core (C₇H₄N₂S, calculated mass 136) with minor modifications, such as hydrogen shifts or partial degradation of the amino substituent. The fragment at m/z 107 (M−111) likely represents the benzothiazole ring system (C₆H₄NS⁺, calculated mass 107) after complete cleavage of the butyl-nitrile side chain. Additional minor peaks at m/z 151 (M−67) and 123 (M−95) suggest stepwise degradation of the aliphatic chain, possibly via α-cleavage or hydrogen rearrangements. The presence of these fragments aligns with the structural features of the molecule: a nitrile group, a flexible butyl linker, and a rigid benzothiazole aromatic system with an amino substituent. Overall, the fragmentation pattern reflects the stability of the benzothiazole aromatic system and the reactivity of the nitrile and aliphatic moieties, providing insights into the structural integrity and breakdown pathways of this heterocyclic compound."

The spectrum displays distinct chemical shifts corresponding to the unique carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at ~170 ppm is attributed to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ester group, which typically resonates in this high-frequency region due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen. A sharp peak near ~120 ppm corresponds to the nitrile carbon (C#N), consistent with the deshielding effect of the triple bond. In the aromatic region (120–150 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the substituted benzene ring. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (Cl and C#N) at the para positions creates distinct chemical environments for the aromatic carbons, leading to splitting of signals. The peak at ~150 ppm likely corresponds to the carbon adjacent to the chlorine substituent, which experiences strong deshielding. Additional peaks in this region (e.g., ~130 ppm) represent other aromatic carbons with varying degrees of shielding. The aliphatic region (0–80 ppm) shows key features of the molecule’s side chains. A triplet-like peak at ~50 ppm is assigned to the methylene group (CH2) directly bonded to the nitrogen atom, which is deshielded by the adjacent electronegative nitrogen. The tert-butyl group (OC(C)(C)C) produces a peak at ~28 ppm, corresponding to its three equivalent methyl carbons. The central quaternary carbon of the tert-butyl group is expected near ~80 ppm but may overlap with other signals or appear as a weaker peak due to its lower sensitivity in C-NMR. The N-methyl group (N-CH3) resonates at ~35 ppm, reflecting its intermediate shielding. The spectrum’s peak intensities align with the number of equivalent carbons in each environment, though some overlap may occur due to similar chemical shifts. For example, the tert-butyl methyls and N-methyl peaks are close but distinguishable. Overall, the observed chemical shifts and peak multiplicities confirm the structural features of the molecule, including the ester, nitrile, chloro-substituted aromatic ring, and aliphatic side chains.

Key features include a prominent peak at approximately 120 ppm, which corresponds to the nitrile carbon (C≡N), a characteristic downfield shift due to the triple bond's electron-withdrawing nature. Several intense peaks between 110–130 ppm are attributed to the fluorinated aromatic carbons, as fluorine's electronegativity deshields adjacent carbons, shifting their signals downfield. Peaks in the 130–160 ppm range likely arise from carbons in the pyridine and oxadiazole rings, with the oxadiazole carbons (particularly the one bonded to oxygen) appearing at higher ppm values due to the electron-withdrawing effects of both nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The absence of signals below 100 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic or sp³-hybridized carbons in the structure.

This downfield shift reflects the electron-deficient nature of the heterocycle. The spectrum’s peak distribution aligns with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of aromatic, alkenyl, aliphatic, and heterocyclic carbons. The absence of overlapping peaks in critical regions suggests minimal conformational flexibility, consistent with the rigid aromatic and conjugated framework.

Additional aromatic protons from the non-fluorinated ring appear as a multiplet in the ~6.5–7.5 ppm region, reflecting their relatively shielded environment compared to the fluorinated ring.

The spectrum’s intensity distribution aligns with the molecular formula: the methyl singlet (3H), aromatic multiplets (4H), and hydroxyl singlet (1H) collectively account for all eight protons. The lack of signals above 12 ppm excludes the presence of strongly acidic protons (e.g., carboxylic acids), while the absence of aldehyde or amine resonances further supports the assigned structure. Overall, the H-NMR data confirm the substitution pattern of the coumarin scaffold, with the methyl group, hydroxyl group, and lactone carbonyl creating distinct electronic environments that govern the observed chemical shifts and splitting patterns."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C13H17NO2 (SMILES: CN1CCC(COc2ccc(C=O)cc2)C1). The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 220, corresponding to the intact molecule, which confirms the molecular weight of 220.48 Da. The base peak (most intense signal) appears at m/z 84, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. Notable peaks at m/z 161, 145, 135, 119, 91, 79, and 57 suggest characteristic fragmentation pathways. The peak at m/z 161 likely arises from the loss of a 59 Da fragment (C3H5NO), consistent with cleavage of the piperidine ring and adjacent oxygen-containing group. The m/z 145 peak may result from further loss of a methyl group (15 Da) from the 161 fragment. The m/z 135 peak corresponds to the benzaldehyde-derived fragment (C8H7O2+), while the m/z 119 peak represents the benzaldehyde ion (C7H7O+) after loss of a methyl group. The m/z 91 peak is characteristic of the tropylium ion, a common aromatic fragment. Additional peaks at m/z 79 and 57 suggest smaller hydrocarbon fragments, possibly from the piperidine ring decomposition. The presence of peaks at m/z 98, 105, 122, 138, 149, 157, and 175 further supports the structural complexity and fragmentation diversity of the molecule. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 220 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity, while the distribution of fragment ions aligns with the proposed structure, which combines a benzaldehyde moiety (m/z 106) linked via an ether bond to a piperidine derivative (m/z 114). This fragmentation pattern is consistent with the SMILES notation provided, highlighting the stability of aromatic systems and the susceptibility of the ether and amine functionalities to cleavage under mass spectrometry conditions."

The spectrum displays characteristic absorption features consistent with the functional groups present in this chiral hydroxycarboxylic acid. A broad, intense band spanning ~3500–2500 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the O–H stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group, exhibiting strong hydrogen bonding. A sharp, prominent peak at ~1715 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the C=O stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid carbonyl group. Additional peaks at ~1250 cm⁻¹ and ~1150 cm⁻¹ arise from C–O stretching vibrations in the carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups, respectively. The region between 2800–3000 cm⁻¹ shows moderate absorption due to C–H stretching in aliphatic CH₂ and CH groups, including those in the cyclobutane ring (CC1CCC1). A distinct peak near 1000 cm⁻¹ likely reflects C–C stretching or ring deformation modes in the cyclobutane moiety. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains multiple complex bands, including bending vibrations of O–H (~1400 cm⁻¹) and C–H (~1350 cm⁻¹), as well as skeletal vibrations of the cyclobutane ring. The absence of absorption above 3600 cm⁻¹ confirms the hydroxyl group is not free (i.e., it is hydrogen-bonded or involved in intramolecular interactions). These spectral features collectively support the assigned structure, with no evidence of extraneous functional groups (e.g., nitriles, carbonyls outside carboxylic acid)."

The spectrum displays several key features characteristic of this molecular structure. The base peak at m/z 328 corresponds to the molecular ion [M]+, confirming the molecular weight of 328 g/mol. The presence of a chlorine atom is evident from the isotopic pattern at m/z 328 and 330, which exhibits a 3:1 relative abundance ratio consistent with the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes. Significant fragment ions are observed at m/z 257 and 259, also showing a 3:1 isotopic ratio, indicating the retention of the chlorine atom in this fragment. This suggests cleavage of the sulfonamide group (SO₂N3CCCC3) from the parent molecule, yielding a fragment with the formula C10H8ClO3. A prominent peak at m/z 245 (with a corresponding chlorine isotope at 247) likely arises from the loss of HCl from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for chlorinated aromatic systems. Additional peaks at m/z 193–195 (triplet with 3:1:3 ratio) suggest further fragmentation involving the pyrrolidine ring (N3CCCC3) and/or the benzofuran core. The peak at m/z 180 corresponds to the benzofuran-2-one moiety (C10H8O3), while m/z 158 may represent the sulfonyl-substituted benzene ring (C8H6ClO3S). The peak at m/z 134 likely results from cleavage of the furan ring, retaining the ketone group. Minor peaks at m/z 226 and 312 could correspond to dimeric species or adducts, though their low abundance suggests they are less significant. The overall fragmentation pattern aligns with the proposed structure, where the chlorine substituent and sulfonamide group influence both the stability of the molecular ion and the pathways of dissociation. This spectrum provides critical insights into the molecular architecture and fragmentation behavior of this chlorinated benzofuran sulfonamide derivative."

The tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) is evident through a prominent cross-peak at ~1.2 ppm (¹H) and ~30 ppm (¹³C), corresponding to the equivalent methyl protons and their attached carbons. A methylene group (OCH2) linking the aromatic rings appears as a correlation at ~4.5 ppm (¹H) and ~65 ppm (¹³C), reflecting the deshielding effect of the adjacent oxygen.

The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to functional groups in the structure. A broad, intense peak near 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of O-H stretching, likely from the hydroxyl group at the C[C@H]1O moiety. Adjacent to this, a sharp peak at ~3300 cm⁻¹ may correspond to N-H stretching from the primary amine (N[C@H]1...). The medium-intensity band near 2900 cm⁻¹ is consistent with C-H stretching in aliphatic regions, such as the piperidine ring (CCNCC) and methylene groups. A prominent, sharp peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration, aligning with the c(=O) group in the pyridone-like ring. This is further supported by the absence of a broad O-H peak in the 2500–3300 cm⁻¹ region, confirming the carbonyl is not part of a carboxylic acid. The doublet near 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1500 cm⁻¹ likely arises from C=C stretching in aromatic or conjugated systems, such as the fused pyridine and pyrrole rings (ncc(Cl)c2c43). Additional bands between 1200–1000 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C-N stretching vibrations from the piperidine nitrogen and the bridgehead amine.

The base peak (highest relative abundance) is observed at m/z 105, indicating a highly stable fragment. Key fragment ions include m/z 147, 164, 177, 191, and 205, which arise from characteristic cleavage patterns of the molecular structure. The molecular ion (m/z 222) suggests the compound retains its full mass, while the M+1 peak (m/z 223) reflects natural isotope abundance, primarily from ¹³C contributions. The base peak at m/z 105 likely corresponds to a stabilized acylium ion (C₆H₅O₂⁺) formed via retro-Diels-Alder fragmentation of the cyclopentanone ring, a common pathway for cyclic ketones. The peak at m/z 147 may result from the loss of a methoxy group (–OCH₃, 31 Da) from the molecular ion, yielding a fragment with formula C₁₁H₁₂O₃. Additional fragments at m/z 164 and 177 suggest sequential losses of neutral species such as CO (28 Da) or CH₂O (30 Da) from the parent structure. The peak at m/z 191 (M – 31) aligns with the loss of a methoxy radical, consistent with the presence of three methoxy substituents on the aromatic ring. The ion at m/z 205 (M – 17) may arise from the elimination of a hydroxyl radical, though this is less common for ethers. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern reflects the molecule’s structural features: a methoxy-substituted aromatic ring fused to a cyclopentanone moiety. The high abundance of oxygen-containing fragments (e.g., m/z 105, 147) underscores the influence of oxygen atoms on bond cleavage and charge localization. Peaks at m/z 135 and 136 could correspond to rearrangement ions or smaller aromatic fragments stabilized by resonance. Overall, the MASS spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule’s stability and fragmentation behavior, with diagnostic peaks confirming the presence of methoxy groups, a ketone functionality, and a rigid bicyclic framework. These features align with the proposed structure (C12H14O4) and its SMILES notation, validating the compound’s identity through mass spectrometric analysis."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, corresponding to the carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak near 50 ppm is attributed to the methoxy group (-OCH3), a characteristic resonance for alkoxy carbons. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~60 ppm arises from the morpholine ring carbons (N2CCOCC2), which typically appear in the 50–70 ppm range due to their proximity to electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed. The signal at ~110 ppm likely corresponds to the aromatic carbon adjacent to the methoxy group on the benzene ring, while the peak at ~120 ppm may represent carbons in the thiazole ring (s-c-N system), which often exhibit shifts in this range due to deshielding by the sulfur and nitrogen atoms. A peak near 150 ppm is consistent with the carbonyl carbon of the carbamic acid group (-NC(=O)O), though its exact position may be influenced by hydrogen bonding or electronic effects. Additional peaks at ~130 ppm and ~160 ppm further support the presence of aromatic and heteroaromatic carbons, reflecting the complex electronic environment of the fused benzothiazole system. The absence of signals below 0 ppm or above 200 ppm confirms the molecule lacks highly deshielded or shielded carbon environments, such as carbonyls in strong electron-withdrawing contexts or sp-hybridized carbons. The relative intensities of the peaks align with the number of equivalent carbons in each environment, though overlap in the aromatic region complicates precise assignment. Overall, the spectrum provides clear evidence of the methoxy, morpholine, aromatic, thiazole, and carbonyl carbons, validating the structural features encoded in the SMILES notation."

The most downfield peak, appearing near 200 ppm, corresponds to the carbonyl carbon of the benzoyl group (C=O), which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent aromatic ring. Additional peaks in the 160–170 ppm range are attributed to the carbonyl carbon of the tert-butyl carbamate (Boc) group, reflecting its intermediate shielding environment. In the aromatic region (120–140 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, corresponding to the six chemically distinct carbon atoms of the benzene ring. These shifts are consistent with substitution patterns, where the electron-withdrawing benzoyl group induces deshielding in the ortho and para positions relative to the carbonyl attachment. The piperazine ring carbons exhibit peaks in the 40–60 ppm range. The two methylene groups adjacent to the nitrogen atoms (N-CH2) appear as distinct resonances due to their asymmetric substitution—one linked to the benzoyl-substituted nitrogen and the other to the Boc-protected nitrogen. The tert-butyl group of the Boc moiety produces a sharp, intense peak near 25–30 ppm, characteristic of its three equivalent methyl carbons. A peak near 20 ppm is observed for the methyl group (CH3) attached to the chiral center adjacent to the benzoyl carbonyl. This carbon is shielded compared to the carbonyl carbons but deshielded relative to typical aliphatic methyl groups due to the inductive effect of the neighboring carbonyl. The spectrum’s sparse region below 10 ppm likely corresponds to residual solvent or minor impurities, as the molecule lacks highly shielded carbons in this range. Overall, the chemical shifts and peak multiplicities align with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of aromatic, carbonyl, aliphatic, and heterocyclic components in the molecule."

These shifts reflect deshielding effects from the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group (-SO2-) and the oxygenated cyclohexene ring. In the aliphatic region (0–4.5 ppm), a sharp singlet at ~4.0 ppm indicates the presence of a hydroxyl proton (-OH) on the cyclohexene ring, though its exact position may vary due to hydrogen bonding.

The high 13C shift confirms the presence of a carbonyl group, while the 1H shift reflects its proximity to the electronegative nitrogen. 4. **Heterocyclic components:** The pyrazole ring (n1cc2c(n1)) is evidenced by cross-peaks in the aromatic region, with one proton near 7.5 ppm (1H) and its attached carbon at ~130 ppm (13C). The tertiary nitrogen in the pyrazole may cause slight upfield shifts for adjacent carbons. The spectrum confirms the connectivity of the molecular framework, with correlations between the aromatic protons and their respective carbons, as well as the aliphatic chains.

The spectrum displays four prominent peaks at chemical shifts of 12.0, 10.0, 8.0, and 6.0 ppm, all appearing as sharp singlets. These features provide key insights into the molecular structure and proton environments. The peak at **12.0 ppm** is characteristic of a highly deshielded proton, likely corresponding to an NH group in a hydrazine (N–NH–) moiety. This downfield shift arises from the electron-withdrawing effects of adjacent nitrogen atoms, which reduce electron density around the proton. Similarly, the **10.0 ppm** singlet suggests another NH proton, possibly within a five-membered heterocyclic ring (e.g., a benzimidazole-like structure), where hydrogen bonding or ring current effects further deshield the proton. The **8.0 ppm** and **6.0 ppm** peaks represent aromatic protons. The 8.0 ppm signal is consistent with pyridine ring protons, which typically resonate in the 8.0–9.0 ppm range due to the electron-deficient nature of the nitrogen-containing heterocycle. The 6.0 ppm signal likely originates from protons on the benzene ring fused to the five-membered heterocycle. The upfield shift compared to typical aromatic protons (6.5–8.0 ppm) may result from shielding effects imposed by the ring system or substituent electronic effects. The absence of splitting patterns (e.g., doublets, triplets) in all peaks suggests either rapid chemical exchange (common for NH protons in protic solvents) or symmetry in the molecular structure that renders certain protons chemically equivalent. The integration of these peaks (not explicitly shown but inferred from intensity) aligns with the molecular formula: two NH protons (12.0 and 10.0 ppm) and six aromatic protons (four from the benzene ring and two from the pyridine ring, distributed between 8.0 and 6.0 ppm). Overall, the spectrum reflects a conjugated system with distinct proton environments in the aromatic and heterocyclic regions, consistent with the proposed structure. The high-field NH peaks and aromatic signals validate the presence of both hydrazine and heterocyclic nitrogen functionalities in C13H13N3."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C16H22N4O3 (SMILES: CC(C)(C)OC(=O)N1C[C@H](N=[N+]=[N-])C[C@@H]1COc1ccccc1). The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the structural complexity of the molecule. The most prominent peak, located near 0 ppm, corresponds to the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) of the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group, a common feature in carbamate derivatives. This signal arises from the equivalent methyl carbons, which typically appear in the 25–30 ppm range but may shift slightly depending on electronic effects. Adjacent to this, a smaller peak around 30 ppm likely represents the CH2 group of the pyrrolidine ring, deshielded by proximity to the electronegative azide (N=[N+]=[N-]) substituent. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed. The resonance near 145 ppm corresponds to the ipso carbon of the phenoxy group (C-O-Ar), which is deshielded due to direct attachment to oxygen. Additional aromatic carbons appear at ~120–130 ppm, consistent with the substituted benzene ring. A sharp peak at ~110 ppm may indicate a meta- or para-substituted aromatic carbon. The carbonyl carbon of the Boc group is expected near 155 ppm, though its exact position may overlap with aromatic signals or shift slightly due to conjugation effects. The upfield region (50–100 ppm) contains peaks for oxygen- and nitrogen-adjacent carbons. The OCH2 group of the phenoxyethane moiety likely resonates near 60–70 ppm, while the CH2 groups of the pyrrolidine ring appear between 40–60 ppm. The azide-bearing carbon in the pyrrolidine ring may exhibit a downfield shift (~50–60 ppm) due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the N3 group. Notably, the spectrum lacks signals in the 160–200 ppm range, confirming the absence of aldehyde, ketone, or ester carbonyls beyond the Boc group. The overall pattern aligns with the molecular structure, where the Boc group, aromatic ring, and aliphatic framework contribute to distinct chemical environments. The high symmetry of the tert-butyl group and the aromatic system simplifies the spectrum, while the azide and ether functionalities introduce characteristic deshielding effects. This analysis underscores the utility of C-NMR in resolving carbon frameworks and validating structural features in complex organic molecules."

The spectrum displays characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups present in the molecule. A sharp, intense peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with the ester (COOCH₃) and amide (CONH) groups in the structure. The ester carbonyl typically absorbs near 1735–1750 cm⁻¹, while the amide carbonyl appears at slightly lower wavenumbers (1630–1690 cm⁻¹), suggesting the dominant peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ may primarily reflect the amide group. A broad absorption band near ~3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the N-H stretching vibration of the secondary amide, which is often broadened due to hydrogen bonding. Additional peaks in the 3000–3100 cm⁻¹ region are attributed to aromatic C-H stretching vibrations from the benzene ring. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) contains multiple distinct peaks. A strong band at ~1500–1600 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of aromatic C=C stretching modes, while peaks near 1200–1300 cm⁻¹ likely arise from C-N stretching in the amide group and C-O stretching in the ester and methoxy (OCH₃) substituents. The methoxy group also contributes to peaks near 1000–1100 cm⁻¹ (C-O-C asymmetric stretching). The absence of a broad O-H stretch (2500–3500 cm⁻¹) confirms the lack of carboxylic acid or hydroxyl groups. Overall, the spectral features align with the expected functional groups in C13H17NO4, including the ester, amide, aromatic ring, and methoxy substituents."

A sharp, well-defined peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ may also indicate N-H stretching from the amide group (-CONH-). The strong absorption band near 1700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with C=O stretching vibrations, likely arising from both the ketone (C=O) and carboxylic acid (COOH) carbonyl groups.

The spectrum displays five prominent peaks at m/z values of 166, 269, 297, 381, and 462, with the base peak (highest relative abundance) observed at m/z 462. This base peak corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, confirming the molecular weight of 461 g/mol for the neutral compound. The presence of fluorine atoms in the structure is consistent with the observed isotopic pattern, though the resolution of this spectrum does not distinctly resolve fluorine’s characteristic isotope peaks (¹⁹F is monoisotopic). The peak at m/z 381 represents a fragment ion resulting from the loss of a C₄H₅N₃ (81 Da) moiety, likely originating from the triazine-containing piperazine side chain (N1CCN(c2ncncn2)CC1). This suggests cleavage at the amide bond linking the central core to the heterocyclic substituent. The fragment at m/z 297 corresponds to a larger structural segment, potentially retaining the imidazole ring (c1nc(-c2ccc(F)cc2)cn1-c1ccc(F)cc1) and part of the amide linkage, indicating stability in this region under ionization conditions. The peak at m/z 269 may arise from further fragmentation of the 297 Da ion, possibly via elimination of a fluorophenyl group (C₆H₄F, 95 Da), though the exact pathway requires tandem MS analysis for confirmation. The lowest-mass significant peak at m/z 166 likely represents a highly stable aromatic heterocyclic fragment, such as the triazine-piperazine unit (C₆H₁₀N₆, 166 Da), which is consistent with the molecule’s SMILES notation. The relative abundances of these fragments suggest that the molecule undergoes preferential cleavage at the amide bond and peripheral substituents, while the core imidazole and triazine rings contribute to the stability of intermediate fragments. This mass spectral profile aligns with the structural features of the compound, including its dual fluorophenyl groups, amide linkage, and polycyclic heteroaromatic system. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 462 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity, while the fragmentation pattern provides insights into the molecule’s structural resilience and decomposition pathways under electron ionization."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides a two-dimensional correlation between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the molecule. The observed cross-peaks correspond to specific ¹H-¹³C pairs, reflecting the molecular structure of CN(C)C(=O)C(C(=O)O)c1ccccc1. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic region (6.5–8 ppm in ¹H, 120–140 ppm in ¹³C)**: Multiple cross-peaks are observed here, consistent with the six aromatic protons and carbons of the benzene ring (c1ccccc1). The chemical shifts suggest a monosubstituted benzene derivative, with protonated aromatic carbons appearing as distinct peaks in this region. 2. **Aliphatic region (2.5–4 ppm in ¹H, 30–60 ppm in ¹³C)**: A prominent cross-peak near 3.5 ppm (¹H) and 55 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methine (CH) group adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) in the central scaffold. Additional peaks around 2.8–3.0 ppm (¹H) and 40 ppm (¹³C) likely arise from the two methyl groups (N(CH₃)₂) attached to the amide nitrogen. 3. **Carboxylic acid carbon (¹³C ~170–180 ppm)**: A ¹³C signal in this region is expected for the carboxyl carbon (C(=O)O), though its directly bonded proton (if observable) would appear as a broad peak outside the typical ¹H range (10–12 ppm) and may not be resolved in this spectrum. The spectrum confirms the presence of protonated carbons in the aromatic ring, the central methine group, and the dimethylamide moiety. The absence of cross-peaks in the ¹³C carbonyl region (160–180 ppm) for the amide and carboxylic acid groups is expected, as these carbons lack directly bonded protons. Overall, the HSQC data align with the proposed structure, providing clear evidence for the connectivity of protonated carbons and aiding in the assignment of the molecule’s ¹H and ¹³C chemical environments."

However, the absence of peaks in this region confirms the presence of quaternary carbonyl carbons, consistent with the two imide carbonyls in the structure (N2C(=O) and C2=O). 3. **Aliphatic Region (¹H 1–4 ppm, ¹³C 20–60 ppm):** Peaks in this region arise from the ethyl group (CCN) and the piperidine ring (CCCCN). The ¹H signals near 3.5–4.0 ppm and ¹³C signals at ~50 ppm correspond to the methylene protons and carbons adjacent to the tertiary nitrogen (N-CH₂). The ethyl group’s CH₂ (connected to nitrogen) appears at ~3.0 ppm (¹H) and ~45 ppm (¹³C), while the CH₃ group is upfield (~1.0 ppm, ¹H; ~12 ppm, ¹³C). 4. **Nitrogen-Bound Protons:** No exchangeable proton signals (e.g., N–H) are observed, consistent with the absence of such groups in the SMILES notation. The HSQC spectrum confirms the connectivity between aromatic protons and their attached carbons, as well as the aliphatic framework.

The spectrum displays key diagnostic peaks that align with the molecular structure and fragmentation patterns typical of this compound. The molecular ion peak [M]+ is observed at m/z 417, corresponding to the intact molecule.

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H11ClN2O2 (SMILES: COCCn1nc2ccccc2c1C(=O)Cl). The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the structural features of the compound. The most downfield signal appears near 200 ppm, consistent with the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the carbonyl chloride functional group, which is highly deshielded due to the electronegativity of oxygen and the inductive effect of chlorine. Adjacent to this, a cluster of peaks between 150–160 ppm corresponds to aromatic carbons in the benzotriazole ring system, where the nitrogen atoms in the heterocycle further deshield these carbons. Additional aromatic signals are observed between 120–140 ppm, representing the remaining carbons in the fused benzene ring. A sharp peak near 50 ppm is attributed to the methylene carbon (CH2) of the OCH2CH2 group, which is deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom. The methyl group (CH3) of the methoxy substituent appears as a singlet around 15 ppm, typical for aliphatic carbons shielded by electron-donating oxygen. The spectrum also shows a moderate-intensity peak near 100 ppm, which may arise from a quaternary carbon in the benzotriazole core or a minor impurity. The absence of signals below 10 ppm confirms the lack of additional aliphatic or methyl groups beyond those in the methoxyethyl side chain. Overall, the spectral features align with the proposed structure, demonstrating characteristic shifts for aromatic, carbonyl, and aliphatic carbons. The integration of peak multiplicities and chemical shifts provides insight into the electronic environment of each carbon, supporting the molecular formula and connectivity defined by the SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks that correlate with the molecular structure. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at 6.0 ppm with high intensity, likely corresponding to the methyl group (-CH3) attached to the triazole ring. This downfield shift (higher ppm) compared to typical aliphatic protons (1–2 ppm) suggests deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent nitrogen atoms in the triazole ring. In the aromatic region (7–12 ppm), several smaller peaks are observed. A triplet at ~10.5 ppm and a doublet at ~10.0 ppm may arise from protons on the fluorinated benzene ring (c2c(F)cccc2Cl), where the electron-withdrawing fluorine and chlorine substituents deshield nearby protons, shifting their signals downfield. The splitting patterns (triplet and doublet) suggest coupling between adjacent aromatic protons. A weaker singlet at ~11.5 ppm could correspond to a proton on the pyridine ring (Oc2ccc(C(F)(F)F)cn2), potentially ortho to the trifluoromethyl group, which further deshields the proton. Another minor peak at ~12.5 ppm might represent a proton meta to the chlorine substituent on the second benzene ring (c1ccc(...)cc1Cl), though its exact assignment requires further analysis. The absence of peaks below 5 ppm indicates no aliphatic protons beyond the methyl group. The integration of peak areas aligns with the molecular formula: the methyl singlet (3H) dominates the spectrum, while the aromatic peaks collectively account for the remaining 9 aromatic protons. The spectrum reflects the molecule’s symmetry and substituent effects, with halogen atoms (Cl, F) and the trifluoromethyl group significantly influencing chemical shifts through inductive and resonance effects. No exchangeable protons (e.g., -OH or -NH) are observed, consistent with the absence of such groups in the SMILES notation. Overall, the H-NMR data confirm the structural features of the compound, including the triazole core, halogenated aromatic systems, and ether linkage."

Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6.5–7.5 ppm):** Two doublets at ~6.7 ppm and ~7.1 ppm (each integrating to 2H) indicate a para-substituted benzene ring, consistent with the c2ccc(N)cc2 moiety. The splitting suggests symmetric substitution, with the amine (-NH2) and cyclobutyl groups occupying para positions. 2. **Aliphatic Region (1.5–3.5 ppm):** - A triplet at ~1.5 ppm (4H) and a multiplet at ~2.0 ppm (2H) correspond to the cyclobutane ring protons (CCC1), split into distinct environments due to the adjacent carbamate and aromatic substituents. - A singlet at ~3.7 ppm (3H) matches the methoxy group (-OCH3) of the carbamate. 3. **Exchangeable Protons (5–6.5 ppm):** - A broad singlet at ~5.5 ppm (2H) is attributed to the primary amine (-NH2) on the aromatic ring. - A broad singlet at ~6.0 ppm (1H) corresponds to the carbamate NH, which typically appears downfield due to hydrogen bonding. The integration ratios (3:4:2:2:1:2) align with the molecular formula, confirming 16 total hydrogens.

The spectrum displays a base peak at m/z 95, which is the most intense signal and likely corresponds to a stable fragment ion derived from the cyclohexane ring structure. The molecular ion (M⁺) is expected at m/z 158 based on the molecular formula, though it is not prominently labeled here; a minor peak at m/z 159 may represent the M+1 isotope peak due to natural carbon-13 abundance. Key fragment ions include peaks at m/z 81, 93, 105, 117, and 123, which suggest sequential losses of small neutral molecules (e.g., H₂O, CO, or CH₂ groups) and ring cleavage events. The peak at m/z 81 could arise from the cyclohexanol moiety after dehydration (loss of H₂O from the molecular ion), while m/z 95 may result from further fragmentation of the ring system, possibly involving cleavage adjacent to the hydroxyl group. The peaks at m/z 105 and 117 may reflect fragments retaining portions of the carboxylic acid side chain, with m/z 123 potentially indicating a rearrangement product. These observations align with typical fragmentation patterns of cyclohexane derivatives, where the ring structure undergoes homolytic or heterolytic cleavage to generate stable carbocations or radical ions. The spectrum underscores the dominance of ring-derived fragments in the mass spectral behavior of this molecule."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of the 21 carbons in the structure. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (100–170 ppm):** - A prominent peak at ~170 ppm corresponds to the amide carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the pyridine-4-carboxamide moiety. - Multiple peaks between 120–160 ppm are attributed to aromatic carbons in the pyridine and fused benzene rings. The pyridine ring carbons (e.g., C-2, C-3, C-5) exhibit shifts typical of electron-deficient heteroaromatic systems, while the benzene ring carbons (C-7 to C-10) show shifts influenced by the sulfonamide (S(=O)₂N) and hydroxylamine (C-NH₂) substituents. 2. **Aliphatic Region (0–100 ppm):** - A sharp peak at ~50 ppm arises from the methylene carbons (CH₂) in the piperidine ring (C-12, C-15), adjacent to the nitrogen atom. - Peaks near 60–70 ppm correspond to the oxygen-bound methylene (CH₂O, C-16) and the benzylic carbon (C-11) linking the piperidine to the aromatic system. - The dimethylamino group (N(CH₃)₂, C-17) appears as a singlet near 30 ppm, consistent with methyl groups attached to a tertiary nitrogen. 3. **Sulfonamide and Heterocyclic Features:** - The sulfonamide group (S(=O)₂N) indirectly influences the chemical shifts of adjacent aromatic carbons (e.g., C-7 and C-10), which resonate at ~130–140 ppm due to deshielding by the electron-withdrawing S(=O)₂ moiety. - The C=N carbon in the sulfonamide-fused benzene ring (C-8) appears near 150 ppm, reflecting its imine-like character. The spectrum’s peak multiplicities and intensities align with the molecular symmetry and substitution patterns. For instance, the equivalence of the two N-methyl groups simplifies their resonance into a single peak, while the piperidine ring’s conformational flexibility may cause slight broadening of its methylene signals. Overall, the C-NMR data confirm the structural integrity of the molecule, with all expected carbon environments accounted for."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, with prominent peaks observed in three key regions. The most intense signal appears near 155–160 ppm, indicative of quaternary aromatic carbons in highly deshielded environments. This region likely corresponds to the carbon atoms adjacent to electronegative heteroatoms (e.g., the oxadiazole ring carbons or fluorinated aromatic carbons), where strong electron-withdrawing effects from nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine atoms significantly deshield the nuclei. Additional major peaks are observed between 130–140 ppm, which are characteristic of aromatic carbons bonded to nitrogen or halogens. These shifts align with the pyridine and quinoline substructures in the molecule, where the nitrogen atoms in the heterocycles induce moderate deshielding. A cluster of signals near 110–120 ppm suggests the presence of fluorinated aromatic carbons, as the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms typically elevates chemical shifts for directly attached carbons. This is consistent with the CF2 group in the molecular structure, which would split into distinct peaks due to the two chemically equivalent fluorines creating a unique electronic environment. A lower-intensity peak near 100 ppm may correspond to the carbon in the oxadiazole ring, which is less deshielded due to its proximity to the oxygen atom and the ring’s electron-deficient nature. The absence of signals below 50 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic or sp³-hybridized carbons in the molecule, consistent with its fully aromatic framework. The spectrum’s peak multiplicity and intensity distribution reflect the molecule’s symmetry and substitution pattern. The broad chemical shift dispersion (100–160 ppm) underscores the diversity of carbon environments, driven by the interplay of halogen (Br, F), nitrogen, and oxygen substituents. Notably, the bromine atom’s weak inductive effect and the fluorine atoms’ strong electronegativity synergistically influence the aromatic ring currents, leading to the observed resonance patterns. This C-NMR spectrum effectively highlights the structural complexity of the compound, with each peak providing critical insights into the electronic and steric properties of its constituent carbons."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 488, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. This peak confirms the molecular formula and serves as the base peak, indicating high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Significant fragment ions are observed at m/z 458, 472, 316, 300, 248, 199, 173, 153, and 147. The peak at m/z 472 (loss of 16 Da) likely results from the cleavage of a fluorine atom (F, 19 Da) or a hydroxyl group (OH, 17 Da), though the exact pathway requires further confirmation. The m/z 458 peak (loss of 30 Da) may correspond to the elimination of a CF group or a nitrile (CN, 26 Da) fragment. The fragment at m/z 316 (loss of 172 Da) suggests a cleavage near the aromatic ether linkage (O-C bond), releasing a portion of the phenoxy group. The m/z 300 peak (loss of 188 Da) could arise from the removal of the entire phenoxy moiety (C6H3ClO, 156 Da) combined with additional fragmentation. Lower-mass fragments at m/z 199, 173, and 153 highlight the breakdown of the heterocyclic core. The m/z 173 peak, a major fragment, likely originates from the pyrimidinone ring system (C6H3ClFN3O2), while the m/z 153 peak may represent a further fragmented heterocycle retaining the chlorine substituent. The m/z 147 peak could correspond to a nitrile-containing aromatic fragment (C6H2ClN2O). Isotopic patterns are evident in the molecular ion region (m/z 488 and 490), reflecting the presence of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes). The absence of significant isotopic splitting in lower-mass fragments confirms the loss of chlorine during fragmentation. Fluorine atoms contribute to the overall mass but do not produce distinct isotopic patterns due to their monoisotopic nature (¹⁹F). The spectrum demonstrates characteristic fragmentation pathways, including heterolytic cleavage of the ether linkage, nitrile group retention, and stability of the pyrimidinone core. These features align with the structural motifs in the SMILES notation, particularly the electron-withdrawing effects of the CF₃ and Cl substituents, which influence fragmentation behavior. The observed peaks provide critical insights into the compound’s structural integrity and decomposition mechanisms under mass spectrometric conditions."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides a two-dimensional correlation between ¹H and ¹³C chemical shifts, revealing direct ¹H-¹³C bonding relationships. In this spectrum, cross-peaks appear where a proton directly attached to a carbon atom exhibits a correlated signal. The ¹H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans approximately -2 to 14 ppm, while the ¹³C chemical shift axis (y-axis) ranges from 0 to 200 ppm. Key features of the spectrum include: 1. **Aromatic region (6–8 ppm, ¹H; 100–150 ppm, ¹³C):** Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to protons and carbons in the thiophene ring (s1 in the SMILES notation). The thiophene’s deshielded aromatic protons and sp²-hybridized carbons produce signals in this area, with the ¹³C shifts reflecting substitution effects from the adjacent amide and tert-butyl groups. 2. **Aliphatic region (0–4 ppm, ¹H; 10–60 ppm, ¹³C):** Prominent cross-peaks here arise from the molecule’s alkyl chains and tert-butyl groups. The tert-butyl protons (C(CH₃)₃) appear as high-intensity peaks near 1 ppm (¹H) and 25–30 ppm (¹³C), characteristic of shielded methyl groups. The methylene (CH₂) and methine (CH) protons in the propyl and butyl chains (e.g., CNCCCN) produce signals in the 1.5–3 ppm range, with corresponding ¹³C shifts reflecting their proximity to electronegative nitrogen and oxygen atoms. 3. **Amide and carbonyl correlations:** While carbonyl carbons (C=O) in the amide and carbonate groups (O(C=O)N) do not directly produce HSQC cross-peaks (as they lack attached protons), their influence is evident in the deshielded ¹H shifts of adjacent protons (e.g., NH or α-CH₂ groups). For instance, the amide N(CH₃)C(=O) group likely contributes to a ¹H peak near 7–8 ppm, correlating with a ¹³C shift around 170 ppm. 4. **High-field methyl groups:** The tert-butyl group attached to the thioether (S-CH₂-C(CH₃)₃) exhibits a distinct cross-peak near 0.8 ppm (¹H) and 30 ppm (¹³C), consistent with its shielded environment. This spectrum highlights the molecule’s structural complexity, including its aromatic heterocycle, branched alkyl chains, and functional groups.

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C9H14O5 (SMILES: CCOC(=O)C(=O)C(C)C(=O)OCC). The spectrum displays five distinct peaks corresponding to the unique carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak at approximately 200 ppm is attributed to the ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the central C(=O)C(=O) moiety. Adjacent to it, the peak at ~170 ppm represents the two equivalent ester carbonyl carbons (C=O) from the ethyl ester groups. These carbonyl shifts are consistent with their respective functional groups, as ketones typically resonate at higher ppm values than esters due to differences in electron-withdrawing effects. At ~60 ppm, the peak corresponds to the two equivalent methylene (CH2) carbons in the ethoxy (OCH2CH3) groups, which are deshielded by their proximity to electronegative oxygen atoms. The peak at ~20 ppm arises from the methyl (CH3) group attached to the central carbon, which is flanked by two carbonyl groups, slightly deshielding it. Finally, the upfield peak near ~10 ppm is assigned to the terminal methyl (CH3) carbons of the ethoxy groups, which experience minimal deshielding. The absence of additional peaks confirms the symmetry of the molecule, as the two ethyl ester groups are chemically equivalent. The integration of peak intensities aligns with the molecular structure, where the ketone and central methyl groups (single carbons) produce lower-intensity signals compared to the two-carbon ester carbonyls and ethoxy groups. This spectrum effectively illustrates the distinct electronic environments of carbons in carbonyl, oxygen-adjacent, and alkyl regions, providing clear evidence for the proposed structure."

The spectrum displays seven distinct resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, consistent with the structural features of the molecule. The most downfield peak, observed near 170 ppm, corresponds to the carbonyl carbons of the ester (COO) and amide (NCO) functional groups. These high-frequency shifts are characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbons in electron-withdrawing environments. The two ester carbonyls (one from the methyl ester and one from the tert-butyl ester) and the amide carbonyl likely contribute to overlapping signals in this region, though slight differences in their electronic environments may cause minor splitting. In the mid-field region (50–80 ppm), three peaks are evident. The resonance near 80 ppm is attributed to the quaternary carbon of the tert-butyl group (C(CH₃)₃), which experiences deshielding due to its attachment to an electronegative oxygen atom. The peak at ~60 ppm corresponds to the methylene carbon (CH₂) adjacent to the ester oxygen (OCH₂), while the signal at ~50 ppm arises from the methoxy group (OCH₃) of the methyl ester. These shifts align with typical values for oxygen-bound aliphatic carbons. The upfield region (0–30 ppm) contains two peaks. The triplet near 30 ppm represents the three equivalent methyl groups of the tert-butyl moiety (C(CH₃)₃), which are shielded due to their sp³ hybridization and distance from electronegative atoms. The final resonance at ~20 ppm corresponds to the two methylene carbons (CH₂) within the pyrrolidine ring, which are shielded by their saturated, non-electronegative substituents. The absence of signals beyond 200 ppm confirms the lack of additional carbonyl or aromatic carbons, consistent with the aliphatic nature of the molecule. The integration of peak intensities aligns with the expected 13-carbon framework, accounting for symmetry in the tert-butyl group and the distinct environments of the ring and substituent carbons. Overall, the spectrum provides clear evidence for the proposed structure, with resonances correlating to all functional groups and carbon environments in the molecule."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption features corresponding to the functional groups present in this aromatic ester-containing compound. A broad, moderate-intensity band near 3350 cm⁻¹ is indicative of N–H stretching vibrations from the primary amine (-NH₂) group attached to the aromatic ring. Sharp, intense peaks in the 3000–3100 cm⁻¹ region correspond to aromatic C–H stretching modes, consistent with the conjugated polycyclic structure. The most prominent peak near 1700 cm⁻¹ arises from the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the ester group, slightly shifted to lower wavenumber due to conjugation with the adjacent aromatic system. Additional strong absorptions near 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1500 cm⁻¹ are attributed to C=C stretching vibrations of the aromatic rings, while a distinct peak around 1200 cm⁻¹ corresponds to C–O stretching of the ester linkage. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex patterns from C–C and C–H bending vibrations, with notable peaks near 800 cm⁻¹ and 700 cm⁻¹ reflecting the substitution pattern on the aromatic rings. The absence of broad O–H stretching bands confirms the lack of hydroxyl or carboxylic acid groups, aligning with the molecular formula. These spectral features collectively validate the structural assignment of this aromatic amine-functionalized ester."

The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 375, corresponding to the intact molecule. This value aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 374.9, confirming the molecular formula. The presence of bromine is evidenced by the characteristic isotope pattern: a secondary peak at m/z 377 (not explicitly labeled in the spectrum but implied by the bromine isotopic ratio of ~1:1 for ⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br) adjacent to the base peak at m/z 375. Notable fragment ions include a peak at m/z 347, representing a loss of 28 Da from the molecular ion. This suggests cleavage of a neutral fragment such as CO or C₂H₄, likely originating from the ethyl ester group (-COOEt) or the quinazoline core. A cluster of peaks at m/z 329, 330, and 331 reflects further fragmentation involving bromine-containing moieties. The m/z 329 and 331 peaks correspond to a fragment retaining bromine, with the 2 Da separation confirming the presence of a single bromine atom (⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br isotopes). This fragment may arise from the loss of HCOOH (46 Da) from the molecular ion, consistent with the ester functionality. Additional peaks at m/z 301 and 302 indicate further degradation, potentially via elimination of a fluorinated aromatic fragment or additional small neutral losses (e.g., HF or CO). The m/z 302 peak may also represent a minor isotopic contribution or a structurally distinct fragment. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 250 suggests that the molecule’s aromatic and heterocyclic framework remains relatively stable under the ionization conditions. Overall, the fragmentation pattern supports the proposed structure, with key cleavages localized to the ester group and peripheral substituents, while the bromine and fluorine atoms are retained in major fragments. This spectrum exemplifies typical behavior for halogenated heterocycles, where isotopic signatures and selective bond cleavage provide critical structural insights."

This aligns with the two cyclohexene rings in the structure, each contributing two vinylic protons (total of four equivalent protons due to molecular symmetry). A secondary peak at ~3.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene (CH₂) groups adjacent to the carbonyl functionality. These protons are deshielded by the electron-withdrawing effect of the ketone group, shifting their resonance downfield compared to typical aliphatic protons.

The absence of signals in the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm) confirms the lack of conjugated aromatic systems, consistent with the provided structure. The peak at ~8.0 ppm is anomalous and may indicate trace impurities or solvent residues (e.g., chloroform-d at 7.26 ppm, though slightly shifted).

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule's diverse structural environments. Key features include: 1. **Carbonyl Region (160–180 ppm):** A prominent peak near 170 ppm corresponds to the amide carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the [C@H](CC2CCCC2)CONH group. This downfield shift is characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons adjacent to electronegative nitrogen. 2. **Aromatic and Heteroaromatic Carbons (110–150 ppm):** Multiple peaks in this range arise from the pyrazine ring (c1cnc...cn1) and the substituted benzene ring. The pyrazine carbons appear between 130–150 ppm due to their electron-deficient nature, while the benzene ring carbons ortho to the electron-withdrawing Cl and SO₂Me groups (c(Cl)c2) are shifted downfield (~135–145 ppm). 3. **Sulfone and Methoxy Carbons (40–60 ppm):** A resonance near 55 ppm is assigned to the methoxy carbons (OCH₃) in the CO(OC) group, while the methyl carbon of the sulfonyl group (S(C)(=O)=O) appears ~45 ppm, deshielded by the adjacent sulfur. 4. **Aliphatic Region (20–40 ppm):** Peaks in this range correspond to the cyclohexyl ring (CC2CCCC2) and the methylene carbon of the methoxymethyl group (COCH₂O).

The spectrum displays correlations between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing key structural features. In the aromatic region (6–8 ppm in ¹H, 110–140 ppm in ¹³C), multiple cross-peaks correspond to protons and carbons in the iodinated benzene ring and the fused imidazole moiety. The iodine substituent induces significant deshielding, shifting adjacent aromatic carbons downfield (130–140 ppm).

The base peak at m/z 246 dominates the spectrum, indicating a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the sulfonate ester linkage (C–O–S) and subsequent rearrangement. This fragment may retain the sulfonyl group attached to the aromatic ring (C7H8O3S, calculated m/z 172) and a portion of the methoxy-substituted biphenyl backbone. Notable peaks at m/z 172 and 213 suggest further fragmentation of the sulfonyl-containing moiety and the furan-substituted aromatic ring, respectively. The m/z 172 peak aligns with the mass of a methoxybenzenesulfonyl fragment (C7H8O3S), while the m/z 213 peak may correspond to a furan-linked aromatic fragment (C12H9O3S). Additional peaks at m/z 245 and 247, adjacent to the base peak, could indicate isotope contributions (e.g., 34S or 13C variants) or minor structural rearrangements. The spectrum also displays peaks at higher m/z values, such as 325, 385, and 417, which may represent partial fragments retaining larger portions of the original structure. For instance, m/z 385 could correspond to the loss of a methoxy group (–OCH3, 31 Da) from the molecular ion, while m/z 325 might arise from cleavage of the ester group (–CO2Me, 59 Da) combined with hydrogen rearrangements. Lower-m/z peaks (e.g., 67, 91, 107) are consistent with common aromatic and aliphatic fragments, such as tropylium ions or methoxy-substituted benzyl species.

The spectrum displays three distinct cross-peaks, indicating three unique protonated carbon environments. The most downfield cross-peak in the ¹H dimension (~6.0 ppm) corresponds to the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the pyrazine ring. This proton signal is slightly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent nitrogen atoms in the aromatic ring. Its associated ¹³C shift (~25 ppm) aligns with typical aliphatic methyl groups bonded to sp²-hybridized carbons. Two additional cross-peaks in the ¹H range of ~3.5–4.5 ppm and ¹³C range of ~50–60 ppm arise from the methylene (CH₂) groups in the 4-methylpiperazin-1-yl substituent. These signals reflect the two distinct CH₂ environments in the piperazine ring: those adjacent to the methylated nitrogen (N-CH₃) and those adjacent to the unsubstituted nitrogen. The moderate deshielding of the protons (3.5–4.5 ppm) is consistent with their proximity to electronegative nitrogen atoms, while the ¹³C shifts (~55 ppm) are typical for aliphatic CH₂ groups in such heterocyclic systems. The absence of additional cross-peaks confirms that all other carbons in the molecule (e.g., the brominated pyrazine carbons and the quaternary nitrogen-bearing carbons) lack directly attached protons.

The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at 2 ppm (integration ~9H), corresponding to the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) of the Boc protecting group. This signal is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent carbonyl and oxygen atoms. A broad singlet near 10 ppm (integration ~1H) is attributed to the carboxylic acid proton (COOH), which appears downfield due to strong hydrogen bonding and deshielding in the acidic environment. A triplet at 7 ppm (integration ~2H) and a multiplet at 7.5–8 ppm (integration ~4H) represent the aromatic protons on the trifluoromethylphenyl ring. The splitting pattern reflects the meta-substitution pattern, with the CF3 group (not directly observed in H-NMR) causing additional deshielding of the ortho and para protons. Two distinct multiplets between 3.5–4 ppm (integration ~2H total) correspond to the diastereotopic methylene protons (CH2) adjacent to the chiral center at the α-carbon. These signals are split by coupling with neighboring protons and the adjacent nitrogen. A smaller peak near 6 ppm (integration ~1H) likely represents the NH proton of the carbamate group, which may appear as a broad singlet due to exchange broadening or coupling with the α-proton. The absence of signals above 12 ppm confirms no additional acidic protons (e.g., phenolic OH), while the lack of peaks below 0 ppm rules out highly shielded environments like aliphatic methyl groups in non-polar contexts. The spectrum’s simplicity in the 1–2.5 ppm region suggests minimal conformational flexibility in the aliphatic chain.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing the connectivity of protons to their attached carbons. The spectrum displays four distinct cross-peaks, each corresponding to a specific ¹H-¹³C pair within the molecule. 1. **Aldehyde Group (¹H ~10.0 ppm, ¹³C ~190 ppm):** The peak at the highest ¹³C chemical shift (~190 ppm) and ¹H shift (~10.0 ppm) is characteristic of a formyl group (CHO). This signal arises from the aldehyde proton directly bonded to the carbonyl carbon, consistent with the SMILES notation indicating an O=Cc moiety. The downfield ¹H shift reflects the deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen in the carbonyl group. 2. **Aromatic Region (¹H ~7.5 ppm, ¹³C ~130 ppm and ¹H ~7.0 ppm, ¹³C ~125 ppm):** Two cross-peaks in the aromatic region (¹H 7.0–7.5 ppm, ¹³C 125–130 ppm) correspond to protons on the benzene ring. The ¹³C shifts are typical for sp²-hybridized carbons in an aromatic system. The ¹H shifts suggest substitution effects: the chlorine atom (electron-withdrawing) and the fused dioxane ring (OCCCO) induce deshielding on adjacent protons. The two distinct peaks indicate non-equivalent aromatic environments, likely due to the asymmetric substitution pattern (Cl and CHO groups at different positions). 3. **Oxygenated Methylene Groups (¹H ~4.5 ppm, ¹³C ~60 ppm):** The peak at ¹H ~4.5 ppm and ¹³C ~60 ppm corresponds to the methylene protons (CH₂) in the OCCCO ring. The ¹³C shift is consistent with carbons bonded to oxygen (O-CH₂), and the ¹H shift reflects their proximity to electronegative oxygen atoms. The symmetry of the dioxane-like ring likely renders the two CH₂ groups equivalent, resulting in a single cross-peak. **Chemical Interpretation:** The spectrum aligns with the proposed structure of 5-chloro-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxepine-7-carbaldehyde. The aldehyde group, chlorine substituent, and fused oxygenated ring create distinct electronic environments for the observed nuclei. The HSQC data confirm the presence of four unique protonated carbons: one carbonyl carbon, two aromatic carbons, and one methylene carbon. The absence of additional peaks suggests symmetry or overlap in other regions, consistent with the molecule’s compact fused-ring system. This analysis underscores the utility of HSQC in resolving complex molecular frameworks by mapping direct ¹H-¹³C correlations."

The presence of smaller peaks at m/z 57, 79, and 116 further supports the breakdown of the aliphatic chain and ester functionalities.

A second singlet at ~11.0 ppm integrates to four protons, assignable to the ortho-positions (H-2' and H-6') of the two symmetric para-methylphenyl groups. The proximity of these protons to the electron-deficient pyrazine ring further deshields them, elevating their chemical shift compared to typical aromatic protons (which usually appear at 6.5–8.5 ppm). A third singlet at ~10.5 ppm corresponds to the meta-protons (H-3' and H-5') of the phenyl rings, also influenced by the pyrazine substituent but to a lesser extent than the ortho-protons. The symmetry of the molecule ensures equivalence between the two phenyl groups, collapsing their signals into a single resonance. The upfield peak at ~4.0 ppm is a singlet integrating to six protons, attributed to the two methyl groups (CH3) attached to the para-positions of the phenyl rings. While methyl groups typically resonate at 2–3 ppm, their deshielding here may arise from ring current effects or steric interactions with the adjacent pyrazine ring. The absence of multiplets suggests minimal spin-spin coupling, consistent with the molecule’s symmetry and the equivalence of proton environments. This spectrum reflects the electronic influence of the pyrazine core on surrounding aromatic systems, producing highly deshielded resonances for both the heterocyclic and phenyl protons. The integration ratios (6:4:2:2) align with the molecular structure, confirming the assignment of methyl, phenyl, and pyrazine protons."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule's diverse carbon environments. Key features include a prominent peak near 170 ppm, consistent with the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the amide group (O=C(NCC1CC1)), which typically appears in this region due to deshielding effects. Additional high-intensity signals are observed between 150–160 ppm, likely corresponding to quaternary carbons in the heteroaromatic systems, such as those in the purine-like core (ncnc2n1C1CC1) and the benzimidazole moiety (n4c(=O)[nH]c5ccccc54). These shifts are characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbons adjacent to electronegative nitrogen atoms. Aromatic carbons in the benzene ring (c5ccccc54) contribute to peaks in the 120–140 ppm range, with chemical shifts influenced by conjugation and substituent effects. The piperidine ring (N3CCC...CC3) and cyclopropyl groups (NCC1CC1, n1C1CC1) generate signals in the 10–50 ppm region, reflecting their aliphatic nature. Notably, the cyclopropyl carbons exhibit shifts slightly downfield of typical aliphatic carbons (20–30 ppm) due to ring strain and proximity to nitrogen atoms. The spectrum also shows moderate-intensity peaks near 50–70 ppm, which may arise from methylene carbons (CH₂) in the piperidine or linker regions, influenced by neighboring heteroatoms. The overall distribution of peaks aligns with the molecular structure, demonstrating the presence of aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic domains. The absence of signals below 0 ppm or above 200 ppm confirms the absence of highly shielded or deshielded carbons beyond the expected functional groups. This C-NMR spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule's carbon framework, supporting the structural assignment of the benzimidazole-purine hybrid scaffold and its substituents."

The spectrum displays several key features characteristic of the molecular structure and its fragmentation pattern. The molecular ion peak (M⁺) appears at m/z 449, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of the compound. This peak confirms the molecular formula and serves as a reference for identifying fragment ions. The base peak (most intense signal) is observed at m/z 203, accompanied by a smaller isotope peak at m/z 205. This pattern arises from the presence of bromine (Br), which exists as two isotopes (⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br) in a ~1:1 ratio. The m/z 203 and 205 peaks likely correspond to a fragment retaining the brominated aromatic ring (C₇H₄BrCl), with the chlorine isotope (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl) contributing to additional minor peaks at m/z 204 and 206. A prominent peak at m/z 91 is characteristic of the tropylium ion (C₇H₇⁺), a common fragment derived from benzyl or phenyl groups. This suggests cleavage of the benzyloxy group (–OCH₂C₆H₅) from the parent molecule. Additional fragment ions at m/z 314 and 315, along with m/z 341 and 343, reflect the retention of chlorine and bromine in smaller substructures. The m/z 315 peak (and its isotope at 314) may correspond to a fragment containing the chlorinated benzene ring, while the m/z 341/343 pair (3:1 ratio) indicates the presence of chlorine in a distinct fragment. Minor peaks at m/z 217 and 204 likely arise from rearrangement or secondary fragmentation processes, such as the loss of neutral molecules (e.g., CO₂ or H₂O) from larger fragments. The overall fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the bromochlorinated aromatic ring, the benzoic acid moiety, and the benzyloxy substituent. This spectrum highlights the utility of isotope signatures (Br and Cl) in identifying halogen-containing fragments and provides insights into the stability of specific structural motifs under mass spectrometric conditions."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the 13 unique carbon environments in the molecule, with chemical shifts distributed across the typical range for sp³ and sp² hybridized carbons. The most downfield peak at ~200 ppm is attributed to the ketone carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the acetyl group (CH₃CO-), a characteristic region for aliphatic ketones. A second prominent peak at ~175 ppm corresponds to the ester carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the isopropyl ester moiety (COOCH(CH₃)₂), consistent with typical ester carbonyl shifts. In the aromatic region (120–150 ppm), three peaks are observed at ~140 ppm, ~130 ppm, and ~125 ppm. These arise from the six aromatic carbons in the para-substituted benzene ring. The peak at ~140 ppm likely represents the carbon directly bonded to the CH₂ group (C1), while the peak at ~130 ppm corresponds to the carbon attached to the ester group (C4). The remaining two peaks (~130 ppm and ~125 ppm) account for the four equivalent aromatic carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) due to symmetry in the para-substituted ring. In the aliphatic region (0–80 ppm), the peak at ~70 ppm is assigned to the methine carbon (CH) of the isopropyl group, deshielded by its attachment to the electronegative oxygen. The peak at ~40 ppm corresponds to the CH₂ group linking the acetyl and aromatic moieties, while the peak at ~30 ppm represents the methyl carbon (CH₃) of the acetyl group. Two additional peaks at ~20 ppm and ~15 ppm are attributed to the two equivalent methyl groups (CH₃)₂ of the isopropyl ester, which appear as a single resonance due to their identical chemical environments. The spectrum’s peak distribution reflects the molecule’s structural symmetry, particularly in the aromatic ring and isopropyl group, reducing the total number of observed peaks compared to the 13 carbons. The absence of peaks below 10 ppm confirms the lack of highly shielded environments, such as long-chain aliphatic groups.

Key features include a prominent peak at ~170 ppm, characteristic of the ester carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the ethyl ester group (-COOCH2CH3). Adjacent to this, a signal at ~60 ppm corresponds to the methylene carbon (-CH2-) of the ethyl ester, while a peak near 14 ppm arises from the terminal methyl group (-CH3) of the same moiety. In the aromatic region (110–150 ppm), multiple sharp peaks are observed. The resonance at ~150 ppm is attributed to the oxygenated aromatic carbon in the benzyl ether linkage (-OCc3ccccc3), where the electron-withdrawing oxygen deshields the adjacent carbon. Peaks between 125–140 ppm correspond to the aromatic carbons in the naphthalene-like core (c1cc...c2ccc...cc2c1) and the thiophene ring (c2ccsc2). The thiophene ring, with its sulfur heteroatom, contributes signals in the 130–140 ppm range due to the deshielding effect of sulfur on the adjacent carbons. Additional peaks at ~115 ppm and ~128 ppm likely represent the aromatic carbons in the benzyl group (-c3ccccc3) and the naphthalene system, respectively. The absence of signals below 100 ppm indicates no sp³-hybridized carbons outside the ethyl ester and benzyl groups. The spectrum’s simplicity in the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm) confirms the lack of additional saturated carbons beyond the ethyl and benzyl moieties. Overall, the C-NMR spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the ester functionality, aromatic systems, and thiophene ring. The chemical shifts and peak multiplicities are consistent with the molecular formula and connectivity, providing clear evidence of the compound’s structural features."

The most prominent peak at m/z 421 corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, confirming the molecular weight of 420.9 g/mol calculated from the given formula. The presence of chlorine is evidenced by the isotopic pattern observed in smaller fragments, such as the doublet at m/z 263 and 265 (separated by ~2 Da), which reflects the natural abundance ratio of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes. Additional significant peaks include m/z 349, which likely represents the loss of a C₃H₄O₂ fragment (72 Da) from the molecular ion, possibly corresponding to cleavage of the amide bond in the CC(O)C(=O)N1CCN moiety. The peak at m/z 251 may arise from further fragmentation of the morpholine ring (N4CCOCC4) or the piperazine ring (N1CCNCC1), while the peaks at m/z 193 and 219 suggest smaller, structurally informative fragments.

The spectrum displays correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing key structural features. The ¹H chemical shifts range from ~3–7 ppm, while the ¹³C shifts span ~50–120 ppm. Notably, three distinct clusters of peaks are observed: (1) a group near 50–60 ppm (¹³C) and 4–5 ppm (¹H), (2) a peak at ~80 ppm (¹³C) and 3–4 ppm (¹H), and (3) a cluster at 100–120 ppm (¹³C) and 6–7 ppm (¹H). The first cluster (50–60 ppm/4–5 ppm) corresponds to methylene (CH₂) groups adjacent to electronegative atoms. In this molecule, these likely arise from the ring’s CH₂ protons near the oxygen and nitrogen atoms, which deshield the carbons and shift their signals downfield. The second peak (~80 ppm/3–4 ppm) is characteristic of a carbon bearing a hydroxyl group (C–OH), consistent with the [C@H](O) moiety in the structure. The hydroxyl group’s electron-withdrawing effect increases the ¹³C shift of the adjacent carbon. The third cluster (100–120 ppm/6–7 ppm) reflects protons on carbons influenced by the trifluoroacetyl group (CF₃). The strong electron-withdrawing nature of CF₃ deshields nearby protons, shifting their ¹H signals downfield, while the attached carbons appear in the 100–120 ppm range due to hybridization and inductive effects. The absence of peaks in the 160–200 ppm region (typical for carbonyls) is expected, as HSQC only detects protons directly bonded to carbons; the ester and amide carbonyls lack attached protons. Similarly, the tert-butyl group’s methyl protons (~1.4 ppm) and their corresponding carbon (~28 ppm) are not visible in the displayed spectral window, likely due to the focus on higher-shift regions. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the ring’s oxygen- and nitrogen-adjacent CH₂ groups, the hydroxyl-bearing carbon, and the CF₃-substituted amide’s influence on neighboring nuclei."

The spectrum displays characteristic peaks across the chemical shift range of 14 to -2 ppm, with distinct signals in both the aromatic and aliphatic regions. The most prominent feature is a sharp, high-intensity singlet at approximately 6 ppm, which likely corresponds to the protons of the central methylene group (–CH2–) adjacent to the nitrogen in the NCCc2cccnc2 moiety. This downfield position suggests deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the neighboring nitrogen atoms. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), multiple smaller peaks are observed, reflecting the complex electronic environment of the pyridine and fluorinated phenyl rings. The fluorine substituent on the phenyl ring (c2ccc(F)cc2) induces a distinct splitting pattern and deshielding of adjacent protons, contributing to the multiplet around 7.5–8.0 ppm. The pyridine rings (c1ccnc and c2cccnc2) exhibit signals in the 7.0–8.5 ppm range, with the peri-protons (adjacent to nitrogen) appearing at lower fields due to strong deshielding. A notable singlet near 10 ppm may arise from the NH proton in the NCCc2cccnc2 side chain, though its exact position could be influenced by hydrogen bonding or solvent effects. The aliphatic region (1–3 ppm) contains weak signals, likely corresponding to the methyl group (–CH3) attached to the central nitrogen (CN), which appears as a low-intensity singlet around 2.5 ppm. The absence of peaks below 0 ppm and the lack of broad signals suggest no significant presence of acidic protons (e.g., –OH or –COOH) or strong intermolecular interactions under the measurement conditions. The overall spectral pattern aligns with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of multiple nitrogen-containing heterocycles, a fluorinated aromatic ring, and aliphatic components. Integration of peak areas would further validate the proton ratios, though this analysis is limited to visual inspection of relative intensities."

These features reflect the presence of three aromatic or sp²-hybridized CH groups in the molecule. The peak at (10.5 ppm, 115 ppm) indicates a proton in a highly deshielded environment, likely adjacent to electronegative nitrogen atoms or within an aromatic system. The ¹³C shift of 115 ppm is characteristic of sp² carbons in heteroaromatic rings, such as those in pyridine or pyrimidine derivatives. The second peak at (8.5 ppm, 135 ppm) corresponds to another aromatic proton, with the ¹³C shift suggesting a carbon atom in a conjugated system, possibly near a nitrogen substituent.

The absence of peaks in the aliphatic region (e.g., below 5 ppm in ¹H and 50 ppm in ¹³C) suggests no isolated CH₃, CH₂, or CH groups outside the aromatic system. Notably, the methoxy group (OCH₃) in the SMILES structure is not directly observable in this spectrum, as its protons are attached to a carbon bonded to oxygen, which may fall outside the displayed spectral window or require specialized acquisition parameters. The observed cross-peaks align with the aromatic and heteroaromatic components of the molecule, specifically the pyridine-like ring (ncccc) and the adjacent nitrogen-containing ring (NN1). These features confirm the presence of three distinct CH environments within the conjugated framework, consistent with the molecular structure. The HSQC spectrum thus provides critical insights into the connectivity between protons and carbons in the aromatic core of C7H8N4O."

Two peaks at ~130 ppm and ~120 ppm are attributed to sp²-hybridized carbons in the pyrazole ring, likely the carbons adjacent to the nitrogens (C4 and C5 in the ring system). These shifts are consistent with aromatic or conjugated systems, where electron-withdrawing nitrogen atoms further deshield the ring carbons.

This fragmentation pattern provides strong evidence for the proposed molecular structure, with chlorine isotopic signatures serving as critical diagnostic markers."

    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C22H19NO3 (SMILES: CCOc1ccc(C(=O)O)c2c3ccccc3n(Cc3ccccc3)c12). The spectrum displays characteristic absorption bands corresponding to functional groups in the structure. A broad, intense peak near 3400 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of a hydroxyl (O-H) group, consistent with the carboxylic acid moiety (–COOH) in the molecule. Adjacent to this, a sharp, strong absorption at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid. The region between 3000–2850 cm⁻¹ shows multiple weak-to-moderate peaks, attributable to C-H stretching vibrations in both aromatic rings and the ethoxy (–OCH₂CH₃) substituent. In the fingerprint region (1500–500 cm⁻¹), several distinct features are observed. A prominent band near 1250 cm⁻¹ arises from C-O stretching in the ethoxy group, while peaks around 1600–1450 cm⁻¹ reflect C=C stretching vibrations in the aromatic rings. The sharp absorption near 1100 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C-N stretching in the indole-like bicyclic system (n(Cc3ccccc3)c12). Additionally, the absence of significant peaks in the 2200–2100 cm⁻¹ region confirms the lack of triple bonds (e.g., C≡C or C≡N) in the structure. The spectral profile aligns with the molecular framework, which includes a carboxylic acid, ethoxy group, and aromatic systems. The observed peaks provide evidence for the functional groups and their vibrational modes, supporting the assigned structure."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C7H6N2O3S2 (SMILES: NS(=O)(=O)c1cc2ccc(=O)[nH]c2s1). The spectrum displays three distinct proton resonances in the high-field region, consistent with the molecular structure. The most prominent peak appears at approximately 12.0 ppm, which is characteristic of the sulfonamide (–SO₂NH₂) protons. These protons are highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonyl group, resulting in a downfield shift. The peak’s intensity suggests two equivalent protons, aligning with the –NH₂ group in the structure. A second peak at ~11.0 ppm corresponds to the pyridone ring’s NH proton. This resonance is also deshielded, likely due to hydrogen bonding and the adjacent carbonyl group (C=O), which withdraws electron density. The chemical shift is consistent with amide-like protons in heterocyclic systems. The third peak, observed at ~8.0 ppm, arises from aromatic protons in the thiophene and pyridone rings. The thiophene ring contributes two protons, while the pyridone contributes one, though their chemical shifts may overlap due to similar electronic environments. Thiophene protons typically resonate between 6.5–8.0 ppm, while pyridone aromatic protons appear slightly downfield due to the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. The integration of this peak likely accounts for three protons, matching the molecular formula. Notably, there are no signals in the aliphatic region (0–4 ppm), confirming the absence of alkyl or sp³-hybridized carbon-bound protons. The spectrum’s simplicity reflects the molecule’s rigid, conjugated framework, which minimizes conformational flexibility. Broadening of the NH₂ and NH peaks suggests hydrogen exchange, common in protic solvents or under acidic conditions. In summary, the H-NMR spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, with resonances attributed to sulfonamide, pyridone NH, and aromatic protons. The chemical shifts and peak intensities provide strong evidence for the molecule’s identity and functional group arrangement."

The spectrum exhibits a complex fragmentation pattern characteristic of a moderately polar organic compound with multiple functional groups. The base peak at m/z 328 dominates the spectrum, suggesting a highly stable fragment ion, likely arising from cleavage of the sulfonamide (S(N)(=O)=O) or carboxylic acid (C(=O)O) groups. A prominent peak at m/z 455 corresponds to the molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 454.5 g/mol for C22H22N4O5S, with the +1 shift indicating protonation. Additional significant peaks at m/z 374 and 356 may represent sequential losses of SO2 (64 Da) or CO2 (44 Da) from the molecular ion. The peak at m/z 91 is characteristic of a benzyl fragment (C7H7+), supporting the presence of the NCc3ccccc3 moiety in the structure. Smaller peaks at m/z 108, 149, and 195 likely correspond to aromatic amine fragments or substituted phenyl rings, while the cluster of peaks between m/z 230–315 suggests further decomposition of the central aromatic system. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 455 confirms the molecular ion assignment. This fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including its sulfonamide, carboxylic acid, and acetamido groups, which are prone to homolytic cleavage under electron ionization. The spectrum provides critical insights into the compound’s stability and decomposition pathways, with the base peak at 328 serving as a key diagnostic feature for identification."

The upfield ¹H shift (1.2 ppm) and ¹³C shift (14 ppm) align with a terminal CH₃ group, while the downfield ¹H (4.2 ppm) and ¹³C (60 ppm) suggest a CH₂ group adjacent to the oxygen (OCH₂CH₃). - Peaks near (3.5 ppm, 55 ppm) and (2.5 ppm, 25 ppm) likely arise from the CH₂ groups in the CCO and cyclohexene moieties, respectively. The intermediate ¹³C shifts (25–55 ppm) indicate sp³-hybridized carbons. 2. **Aromatic/heteroaromatic region (¹H: 6–8 ppm; ¹³C: 100–150 ppm):** - A prominent peak at (7.5 ppm, 130 ppm) and a cluster near (6.5–7.0 ppm, 110–120 ppm) correspond to protons in the pyrazole and triazole rings. These shifts are characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbons in nitrogen-containing heterocycles. - The ¹³C shifts (110–130 ppm) are consistent with aromatic carbons bearing nitrogen substituents. 3. **High-field region (¹H: 10–12 ppm; ¹³C: 150–170 ppm):** - A distinct peak at (11 ppm, 150 ppm) may arise from a proton on a carbon adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, such as a nitrogen or carbonyl. This could correspond to the triazole ring’s C-H or a deshielded position in the fused bicyclic system. 4. **Absence of signals:** - No peaks are observed above 170 ppm in the ¹³C dimension, confirming the carbonyl carbon (C=O in the ester) lacks directly attached protons, as expected. The spectrum reflects the molecule’s structural complexity, with clear differentiation between aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic environments. The HSQC data supports the presence of ethyl ester and hydroxyethyl substituents, as well as fused nitrogen-containing rings, consistent with the provided SMILES notation.

The spectrum displays several key features characteristic of this compound. The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is observed at m/z 324, confirming the molecular weight of the compound. This peak represents the intact molecule, consistent with the calculated mass of 324.4 g/mol based on the given formula. The base peak, representing the most abundant fragment, appears at m/z 246, indicating a stable fragment ion formed via cleavage of the parent molecule. This fragment likely corresponds to the loss of a methylsulfonyl (CH₃SO₂) group (mass 78) from the molecular ion, as 324 − 78 = 246. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 245 and 246, which may arise from isotopic contributions of bromine (⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br) and chlorine (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl), both of which exhibit natural isotopic abundances. The bromine isotope pattern (approximately 1:1 ratio for ⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br) and chlorine’s 3:1 ratio (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl) are evident in smaller peaks spaced two mass units apart, such as those at m/z 165/166 and 229/230. These likely correspond to fragments retaining bromine or chlorine atoms. For example, the peak at m/z 165 could represent a fragment containing bromine (e.g., C₆H₃BrClN), while the peak at m/z 150/151 may correspond to a triazole-derived fragment (e.g., C₃H₂N₃O₂S) with chlorine isotopes. The peak at m/z 210 may indicate a fragment retaining both bromine and chlorine, such as a substituted benzene ring (C₆H₃BrCl). Smaller peaks at m/z 130 and 150 suggest further fragmentation of the heterocyclic or aromatic components. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 324 confirms the molecular ion’s stability under the ionization conditions.

This peak likely corresponds to the proton adjacent to the ester (-COOCH3) and cyano (-C#N) substituents on the central benzene ring, which experiences deshielding due to electron-withdrawing effects. Additional aromatic protons from the naphthalene and benzene rings appear as multiplets in the 7.2–7.6 ppm range, reflecting complex splitting patterns typical of polycyclic aromatic systems.

The most downfield peak, appearing near 150 ppm, corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the amide group, which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Aromatic carbons dominate the region between 120–140 ppm, with multiple peaks arising from the two substituted benzene rings. The chlorinated benzene ring (c1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl) exhibits signals in this range, with the electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms causing downfield shifts for adjacent carbons. The second aromatic ring, substituted with a sulfonamide group (-SO2-), also contributes to this region, with additional splitting due to the asymmetric substitution pattern. In the aliphatic region (0–70 ppm), several key features are observed. A prominent peak near 70 ppm is assigned to the methylene carbon (-CH2-) directly bonded to the ether oxygen (COCH2O), which is deshielded by the electronegative oxygen.

These shifts are consistent with the electron-withdrawing effects of the sulfone (-SO2-) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups. A minor peak near 20 ppm may correspond to a less intense or overlapping signal, though the molecule lacks methyl groups, suggesting it could arise from a minor impurity or overlapping aromatic carbon resonance. The spectrum’s peak multiplicities and intensities align with the molecular symmetry and substitution patterns. The absence of signals above 160 ppm confirms the lack of additional carbonyl groups or highly deshielded carbons beyond the amide.

In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of the molecule’s aromatic carbons. The benzene rings substituted with methoxy and carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups exhibit shifts between 110–140 ppm, with deshielding effects from electronegative substituents causing downfield shifts. The pyrimidine ring (nc2nc3cn[nH]c23) contributes additional peaks in this range, as carbons adjacent to nitrogen atoms typically resonate at higher ppm values (120–160 ppm) due to the inductive effect of nitrogen. A distinct peak near 170 ppm is attributed to the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (-COOH), which aligns with the expected range for such functional groups (160–185 ppm).

    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C16H24N2O3 (SMILES: COCCNC1CCN(C(=O)OCc2ccccc2)CC1). The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption features corresponding to its functional groups. A broad, moderate-intensity peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the N–H stretching vibration of the secondary amine group. The sharp, intense band at approximately 1710 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the carbamate moiety. Additional peaks in the 2800–3000 cm⁻¹ range arise from aliphatic C–H stretching vibrations in the ethyl and cyclohexyl fragments. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays multiple distinct bands. Peaks near 1250 cm⁻¹ and 1100 cm⁻¹ are consistent with C–O stretching vibrations from the ether and carbamate groups. Aromatic C–H bending vibrations from the benzyl substituent are evident near 690–750 cm⁻¹, while the absence of strong absorption above 3600 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of free O–H groups. The spectrum also shows minor peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1500 cm⁻¹, likely due to aromatic ring C=C stretching modes. The observed features align with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of carbamate, ether, secondary amine, and aromatic functionalities. The carbonyl peak’s position and intensity are particularly diagnostic of the carbamate group’s electronic environment, while the N–H stretch distinguishes this compound from structurally similar tertiary amines. This spectrum provides a comprehensive overview of the molecule’s vibrational characteristics, enabling identification and structural validation."

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 14–10 ppm, with no significant signals observed below 10 ppm. The most prominent features include: 1. **A sharp singlet at 12.5 ppm**: This highly deshielded proton likely corresponds to the phenolic -OH group in the molecule. The downfield shift is consistent with hydrogen bonding or strong electron-withdrawing effects from the adjacent aromatic ring and sulfur atom. 2. **A broad singlet at 11.0 ppm**: This peak may arise from the NH proton of the hydrazone moiety (N=C-NH), which is typically deshielded due to conjugation with the adjacent carbonyl group and imine functionality. 3. **A singlet at 10.5 ppm**: This signal could be attributed to the NH proton of the imine group (C=N-H), further deshielded by the electron-withdrawing effects of the quinoline-like ring system. 4. **A doublet at 8.5 ppm (integration ~2H)**: These protons likely belong to the aromatic positions ortho to the sulfur atom in the thioether-linked benzene ring. The splitting suggests coupling with adjacent protons on the same ring. 5. **A multiplet between 7.5–7.0 ppm (integration ~8H)**: This region corresponds to the remaining aromatic protons across the two benzene rings and the quinoline core. The overlapping signals reflect the complex substitution pattern, with varying degrees of deshielding from electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., carbonyl, imine, sulfur). 6. **A singlet at 7.0 ppm**: This distinct peak may represent a proton on the benzene ring para to the thioether linkage, where symmetry reduces coupling interactions. The absence of signals below 7 ppm aligns with the molecule’s lack of aliphatic protons, consistent with the SMILES notation. The high degree of aromaticity and conjugation explains the broad dispersion of chemical shifts (up to 12.5 ppm), while the integration pattern supports the molecular formula. The spectrum highlights the influence of electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyl, imine, sulfur) on proton deshielding and provides insight into the molecule’s rigid, planar structure."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 364, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 363 g/mol for C23H29N3O. The base peak (highest relative abundance) appears at m/z 208, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 84, 99, 181, 207, 251, 252, 279, 280, 281, 291, 292, 336, and 364. The peak at m/z 336 (364 - 28) suggests the loss of an ethyl group (C2H5, 29 Da) from the molecular ion, likely originating from the diethylamidine moiety (CCN(CC)C(=N)-). The fragment at m/z 291 (364 - 73) may correspond to the loss of a piperidine ring fragment (C5H10N, 84 Da) or a combined loss of ethyl and other small neutral species. Peaks at m/z 279, 280, and 281 likely arise from further fragmentation of the benzofuran-piperidine core, with m/z 279 representing a cleavage product retaining the benzofuran (C8H6O, 134 Da) and part of the piperidine ring. The base peak at m/z 208 (364 - 156) suggests a stable fragment retaining the benzofuran and piperidine moieties, with the loss of the diethylamidine group. The adjacent peak at m/z 207 may represent a dehydrogenated variant of this fragment. Peaks at m/z 251 and 252 could correspond to rearrangement ions involving the benzofuran oxygen or piperidine nitrogen, while m/z 181 may reflect a smaller aromatic fragment from the benzofuran system. The low-abundance peaks at m/z 84 and 99 likely originate from aliphatic fragments of the piperidine ring or ethyl substituents. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 364 confirms the molecular ion assignment. This fragmentation pattern is consistent with the structural features of the molecule, including the diethylamidine, benzofuran, and piperidine components, which undergo predictable cleavage under mass spectrometric conditions. The spectrum provides clear evidence for the molecular identity and structural motifs of C23H29N3O."

The spectrum displays characteristic chemical shifts that align with the structural features of the compound. Notably, the presence of two distinct carbonyl carbon environments is evident: one near 170 ppm, corresponding to the amide carbons (C=O) in the N-methylamide and benzamide moieties, and another at ~200 ppm, which may indicate a deshielded carbonyl or a minor impurity. Aromatic carbons from the benzene and thienyl rings dominate the region between 100–150 ppm, with the chlorine substituent on the phenyl ring causing downfield shifts (~130–140 ppm) for adjacent carbons due to its electron-withdrawing effect. The thienyl sulfur atom further deshields adjacent carbons, contributing to peaks in the 120–135 ppm range. Aliphatic regions show signals at ~60 ppm (CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen in the ethylene bridge and ethanolamine side chain) and ~20 ppm (N-methyl group). The spectrum’s intensity distribution reflects the relative abundance of each carbon environment, with aromatic and amide carbons exhibiting stronger signals due to their higher multiplicity. This analysis confirms the structural integrity of the compound, highlighting key functional groups and their electronic environments."

The spectrum displays distinct proton resonances across the chemical shift range of 14 to -2 ppm, with key features reflecting the structural complexity of the molecule. The most prominent peak occurs near 2 ppm as a singlet with high intensity. This signal likely corresponds to the methyl groups of the isopropyl moiety (CH(CH3)2) attached to the nitrogen atom. The chemical shift is consistent with aliphatic protons shielded by the adjacent carbon framework, and the singlet suggests symmetry or rapid rotation averaging coupling interactions. Between 3–5 ppm, multiple overlapping peaks are observed, indicative of protons in oxygenated or nitrogenated environments. The CH2 group adjacent to the chlorine atom (CH2Cl) is expected in this region (typically 3.5–4.5 ppm) due to deshielding by the electronegative chlorine. Additionally, the sugar ring protons (from the glucosyl moiety, C1O[C@H](CO)[C@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]1O) contribute to this pattern, with the anomeric proton (C1) often appearing near 5 ppm and other ring protons (C2–C5) distributed across 3–4.5 ppm. The hydroxyl protons (OH) of the sugar may appear as broad signals if not exchanged with deuterated solvent. The region from 6–8 ppm contains several sharp peaks of moderate intensity. These are likely associated with the NH protons of the urea group (N–H–C=O), which typically resonate in this range. However, their exact appearance (e.g., broadening or splitting) may depend on hydrogen bonding and solvent conditions. The absence of aromatic signals confirms the lack of conjugated π-systems in the structure. A minor peak near 1 ppm may correspond to the CH proton of the isopropyl group, which is typically split into a septet due to coupling with the two methyl groups. The integration and splitting patterns here would provide further confirmation of this assignment. Overall, the spectrum reflects the molecule’s functional diversity, including aliphatic, halogenated, carbohydrate, and urea components. The chemical shifts and peak multiplicities align with expectations for the given structure, though precise assignments would benefit from additional data such as integration or 2D NMR experiments."

Sharp peaks around 2950 cm⁻¹ and 2850 cm⁻¹ correspond to C–H stretching vibrations in the alkyl groups (tertiary carbon and ethyl chain). A moderate band near 1650 cm⁻¹ may arise from C=N stretching in the pyrazole ring, while a weaker feature at ~1550 cm⁻¹ could indicate N–H bending modes in the amine or ring. The strong absorption at ~1050 cm⁻¹ is consistent with C–O stretching in the alcohol. Additional sharp peaks below 1000 cm⁻¹, particularly near 800 cm⁻¹, likely correspond to out-of-plane N–H bending or ring deformation modes specific to the pyrazole heterocycle. The absence of significant absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms no carbonyl (C=O) groups are present, aligning with the molecular formula.

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C10H8BrNS (SMILES: BrCc1csc(-c2ccccc2)n1). The spectrum displays distinct peaks that correlate with the molecular structure. The most prominent feature is a singlet at approximately 7 ppm with high intensity, likely corresponding to the five aromatic protons of the monosubstituted benzene ring (c2ccccc2). This region is typical for aromatic hydrogens, and the singlet suggests symmetry or rapid rotation averaging the chemical environment of these protons. Additional peaks are observed in the downfield region (10–12 ppm). A sharp singlet near 10 ppm, with moderate intensity, is consistent with the proton on the thiazole ring (position 5 in the heterocycle), which is deshielded by the adjacent sulfur and nitrogen atoms. Another singlet at ~11 ppm, with slightly lower intensity, likely corresponds to the two equivalent protons of the bromomethyl group (-CH2Br). The high chemical shift of this signal reflects the strong deshielding effect of the electronegative bromine atom. The absence of splitting in these peaks indicates minimal coupling between the observed protons. For instance, the -CH2Br protons appear as a singlet, suggesting no adjacent protons on the neighboring carbon (the thiazole ring carbon to which they are attached lacks hydrogens). Similarly, the thiazole proton’s singlet implies no coupling to nearby protons, consistent with its position in the heterocycle. No significant signals are observed in the upfield region (0–5 ppm), which aligns with the absence of aliphatic or shielded protons in the molecule. The spectrum’s simplicity—dominated by singlets—reflects the molecule’s structural symmetry and the electronic effects of its functional groups. In summary, the H-NMR spectrum confirms the presence of aromatic, heterocyclic, and brominated aliphatic moieties in the molecule, with chemical shifts and splitting patterns matching the proposed structure of BrCc1csc(-c2ccccc2)n1."

The spectrum displays several key features characteristic of the compound's structure. The most prominent peak appears at 2 ppm as a singlet with high intensity, likely corresponding to the methylene (CH2) groups in the piperazine-like ring and/or the benzyl CH2 group adjacent to the aromatic ring. These protons are deshielded due to their proximity to electronegative nitrogen atoms and the aromatic system, resulting in their downfield shift. A distinct singlet at 10 ppm is observed, which may arise from the NH proton of the Boc-protected amine. This proton is significantly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding or the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl group. Alternatively, this peak could correspond to a highly deshielded aromatic proton on the thiazole or pyridine ring, though such shifts are atypical for these systems. Aromatic protons from the benzene and pyridine rings are evident in the 7–8 ppm region. The benzene ring (para-substituted with the CH2-piperazine group) likely contributes two doublets in this range due to its symmetric substitution pattern. The pyridine ring protons, particularly those adjacent to the nitrogen, may also resonate here, with the most downfield proton appearing near 8 ppm. A peak at 4 ppm, likely a singlet or broad signal, corresponds to the methylene protons of the CH2 group attached to the oxygen in the morpholine-like ring ([C@H]3COc4...). This group is deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom. Additional smaller peaks at 6 and 8 ppm may represent residual aromatic protons or minor conformational isomers. The absence of a distinct singlet near 1.4 ppm (expected for the Boc group’s tert-butyl) suggests either overlap with other signals or low baseline resolution. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the influence of heteroatoms and aromatic systems on proton chemical shifts."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C14H10Cl2N2O (SMILES: COc1ccc(-c2cn3cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c3n2)cc1). The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates 1H and 13C chemical shifts for directly bonded proton-carbon pairs, providing insights into the molecular structure. The spectrum displays four distinct cross-peaks, each corresponding to a unique CH or CH3 environment in the molecule. 1. **Methoxy Group (OCH3):** A prominent cross-peak is observed at approximately (δH 6.1 ppm, δC 50 ppm). This corresponds to the methoxy group (-OCH3) attached to the benzene ring. The 1H chemical shift at 6.1 ppm is slightly downfield compared to typical aliphatic methoxy protons (usually ~3.3–4.0 ppm), likely due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent aromatic system and possible through-space interactions. The 13C shift at 50 ppm aligns with the expected range for a methoxy carbon. 2. **Aromatic CH Groups:** Three additional cross-peaks are observed in the aromatic region: - A peak at (δH 12.5 ppm, δC 100 ppm) suggests a highly deshielded aromatic proton, likely adjacent to electronegative atoms (e.g., nitrogen or chlorine) in the bicyclic heteroaromatic system. This extreme downfield shift is characteristic of protons near strong electron-withdrawing groups or participating in hydrogen bonding. - A peak at (δH 11.5 ppm, δC 120 ppm) also indicates a deshielded aromatic proton, possibly on the benzene ring ortho to the methoxy group or within the chlorinated heterocycle. - A peak at (δH 7.5 ppm, δC 130 ppm) represents a typical aromatic CH group in a less perturbed environment, likely on the benzene ring or the heterocycle. 3. **Quaternary Carbons:** No peaks are observed for quaternary carbons (e.g., carbons bearing chlorine or nitrogen substituents), as HSQC only detects protons directly attached to 13C nuclei. The absence of signals in the 150–170 ppm range confirms the lack of additional protonated carbons in highly deshielded environments. The spectrum reflects the symmetry and substitution pattern of the molecule. The methoxy group and aromatic protons on the benzene ring (δH ~7.5 ppm) are consistent with the para-substituted benzene moiety in the SMILES structure. The deshielded protons (δH >11 ppm) likely arise from the chlorinated bicyclic heterocycle, where electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms and nitrogen atoms induce significant downfield shifts. This HSQC data, combined with the molecular formula and SMILES, confirms the presence of a methoxy-substituted benzene ring fused to a dichlorinated nitrogen-containing heterocycle, with all protonated carbons accounted for in the observed cross-peaks."

The spectrum displays characteristic chemical shifts that align with the structural features of the compound. Notably, a prominent peak near 200 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon of the ester group (C=O), consistent with its deshielded environment. Peaks in the 150–170 ppm range are indicative of aromatic carbons, likely from the quinoline and phenyl rings, which experience strong electron-withdrawing effects from adjacent nitrogen atoms and conjugated systems. A sharp signal around 130–140 ppm suggests a sp2-hybridized carbon in the dihydropyridine ring, while the resonance near 110–120 ppm may correspond to the nitrile carbon (C#N), which is typically observed in this region due to its triple-bonded nature. Additional peaks at ~50 ppm and 20–30 ppm are consistent with aliphatic carbons: the former likely represents the methine carbon (CH) adjacent to the nitrile group, and the latter correspond to the methyl groups (CH3) on the isopropyl ester and dihydropyridine ring. The absence of signals below 10 ppm confirms the lack of long-chain aliphatic or highly shielded environments.

    "text": "This is an IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C9H9ClO (SMILES: O=CCCc1ccc(Cl)cc1). The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption features corresponding to the functional groups and structural motifs in this compound. A prominent peak at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration, consistent with the aldehyde group (O=CH-) in the structure. This absorption is sharp and intense, reflecting the strong dipole moment change during the vibration of the polar C=O bond. In the region near 3000 cm⁻¹, multiple peaks are observed, corresponding to C-H stretching vibrations. The bands just above 3000 cm⁻¹ (e.g., ~3030 cm⁻¹) are attributed to aromatic C-H bonds from the chlorinated benzene ring, while those below 3000 cm⁻¹ (~2850–2950 cm⁻¹) arise from aliphatic C-H bonds in the propyl chain (CCC) linking the aldehyde to the aromatic ring. A distinct peak near 2720 cm⁻¹ may correspond to the aldehyde C-H stretch, which is typically weaker and slightly lower in frequency than other C-H stretches due to resonance effects. The spectrum also shows a moderate absorption near 1000 cm⁻¹, likely associated with C-Cl stretching vibrations from the chlorine substituent on the benzene ring. This band is consistent with the presence of a carbon-halogen bond, which typically appears in the 500–800 cm⁻¹ range but may shift slightly depending on the molecular environment. Additional weaker peaks in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) correspond to complex bending and deformation vibrations of the aromatic ring, C-C bonds, and other skeletal motions. Notably, the absence of broad absorptions near 3200–3600 cm⁻¹ suggests no significant O-H or N-H functional groups are present, aligning with the provided molecular formula. The observed spectral features collectively support the structural assignment of 3-(4-chlorophenyl)propanal, with the aldehyde, aromatic ring, and chlorine substituent each contributing distinct diagnostic peaks. This IR spectrum serves as a valuable tool for identifying the functional groups and verifying the molecular identity of C9H9ClO."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 469, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 468.46 g/mol for C24H24N2O8. The base peak at m/z 469 (100% relative abundance) indicates high stability of the protonated species under the ionization conditions. A significant peak at m/z 451 (60% abundance) suggests the loss of water (H2O, 18 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for molecules with hydroxyl or carboxylic acid groups. Additional peaks at m/z 452 (35% abundance) and 433 (20% abundance) may arise from further dehydration or rearrangement processes. In the lower m/z region, notable peaks at 154 (20% abundance) and 156 (15% abundance) likely correspond to aromatic fragments derived from the methoxy-substituted benzene rings in the structure. These fragments may retain portions of the amine or carboxylic acid functionalities, as evidenced by the spacing of 2 Da, which could indicate isotope effects (e.g., 12C/13C) or structural isomers. Peaks at 313 (40% abundance) and 342 (10% abundance) suggest cleavage of the central aromatic system, potentially retaining one or both carboxylic acid groups. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms in the molecule is reflected in the prevalence of oxygen-containing fragments, such as those at m/z 254 (25% abundance) and 298 (15% abundance), which may result from successive losses of methanol (CH3OH, 32 Da) or other small neutral molecules. The spectrum also shows minor peaks at 405, 419, and 435, indicating further fragmentation of the methoxy-rich aromatic framework. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including its two methoxy-substituted aromatic rings, carboxylic acid groups, and central amine linkage. The high abundance of the [M+H]+ ion and water-loss fragment underscores the molecule’s propensity for protonation and dehydration under mass spectrometric conditions."

The spectrum reveals several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to key functional groups in the structure. A prominent sharp peak at ~1740 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an ester carbonyl group (C=O), consistent with the ethyl ester moiety (CC(=O)OCC) in the molecule. A strong, broad absorption near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of a terminal alkyne (C≡C-H), aligning with the CC#C group in the structure. The aromatic ring (c1ccccc1) is evidenced by multiple medium-intensity peaks in the 1600–1450 cm⁻¹ region, corresponding to C=C stretching vibrations. A distinct band at ~2100 cm⁻¹ further supports the alkyne functionality (C≡C stretch). The sulfonate ester group (OS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F) contributes to the strong absorption near 1150 cm⁻¹, attributed to S-O stretching, while the trifluoromethyl group (CF₃) likely contributes to the complex band structure between 1100–1000 cm⁻¹. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) displays additional peaks from C-H bending, S-O-C vibrations, and CF₃ deformations. No broad O-H absorption is observed, confirming the absence of hydroxyl groups.

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 14 to -2 ppm, reflecting the diverse electronic environments of hydrogen atoms in the molecule. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet near 10 ppm, which corresponds to the aromatic proton on the pyridazine ring (adjacent to the chlorine substituent). This downfield position is characteristic of deshielded protons in electron-deficient aromatic systems, consistent with the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine atom at the para position. Between 7.0 and 8.5 ppm, multiple overlapping peaks are observed, representing aromatic protons from the benzyl group (Cc4ccccc4) and the pyridazine ring. The benzyl protons (CH₂ attached to the aromatic ring) likely contribute to the multiplet around 4.0–4.5 ppm, where signals are split due to coupling with adjacent protons. The broad peak near 3.5 ppm may arise from methylene groups (CH₂) in the saturated six-membered ring (C3CCCC), which experience moderate shielding. In the aliphatic region (0.5–2.5 ppm), a series of complex multiplets are visible, corresponding to the cyclohexane ring protons and other aliphatic CH₂ groups. These signals exhibit coupling patterns typical of non-equivalent protons in a rigid bicyclic framework. The absence of signals below 0 ppm confirms the lack of highly shielded environments, such as those near electron-donating groups or in strained rings. The integration of peak areas aligns with the molecular formula, with the aromatic region (7–10 ppm) accounting for approximately 6 protons (5 from the benzyl ring and 1 from the pyridazine), while the aliphatic and methylene regions account for the remaining 19 protons. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s stereochemical and electronic diversity, including contributions from the chlorinated aromatic system, the benzyl-substituted nitrogen, and the saturated heterocyclic core. This H-NMR profile provides critical insights into the molecule’s structural features, including substitution patterns and conformational rigidity."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei in covalent bonds, enabling assignment of protonated carbons. The spectrum displays distinct clusters of peaks corresponding to the molecule's structural features. In the aromatic region (¹H 6.5–8.5 ppm, ¹³C 100–160 ppm), several cross-peaks are observed. These arise from the benzene ring (substituted with methoxy and isopropyl groups) and the pyrimidine ring (part of the Oc2cnc(NC3CCSCC3)nc2N moiety). The benzene ring protons (likely at positions 2 and 6) correlate with carbons in the 120–140 ppm range, reflecting deshielding by electronegative oxygen substituents. The pyrimidine ring’s C-H groups (e.g., at position 5) appear in a similar region, with ¹³C shifts slightly downfield due to the electron-withdrawing nitrogen atoms. Methoxy groups (OCH₃) are evident as intense cross-peaks at ¹H ~3.8 ppm and ¹³C ~55 ppm, consistent with their high electron density and shielding. The isopropyl group (C(C)C) shows correlations for its CH proton (~¹H 2.8 ppm, ¹³C ~28 ppm) and two equivalent CH₃ groups (~¹H 1.2 ppm, ¹³C ~20 ppm). The thiomorpholine ring (NC3CCSCC3) contributes peaks in the aliphatic region. The CH₂ groups adjacent to sulfur (S-CH₂) exhibit downfield ¹³C shifts (~35–45 ppm) due to the sulfur’s inductive effect, with corresponding ¹H signals at ~2.5–3.0 ppm. The CH₂ groups near nitrogen (N-CH₂) appear at slightly higher fields (~¹H 2.0–2.5 ppm, ¹³C ~25–30 ppm). Notably, the spectrum lacks correlations for quaternary carbons (e.g., the benzene C1 and C4 positions, or the pyrimidine C2 and C4), as HSQC only detects carbons with directly attached protons. Exchangeable protons (e.g., NH groups) are also absent, as they are typically not observed in standard HSQC experiments. Overall, the HSQC data aligns with the molecule’s structure, confirming the presence of aromatic systems, methoxy substituents, an isopropyl group, and a thiomorpholine ring.

The molecular ion region (m/z 400–450) shows a peak at m/z 435, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 434 g/mol for C25H26N2O3S. Additional peaks at m/z 209, 210, 340, 341, and 355 suggest fragmentation patterns typical of aromatic and sulfonamide-containing compounds. The peak at m/z 91, a diagnostic fragment for benzyl groups, indicates the presence of a tropylium ion derived from the benzyl substituents in the molecule. The adjacent peak at m/z 92 may represent an isotopic contribution or a related fragment. Peaks at m/z 131 and 132 likely arise from cleavage of the sulfonamide (N–S) bond, releasing a methylsulfonyl group (CH3SO2) or its derivatives. The intense peak at m/z 181, the base peak, suggests a stable fragment formed via cleavage of the amide bond and loss of a phenylalanine-like moiety (C9H9NO), leaving a sulfonamide-substituted phenethyl fragment. Higher-mass fragments at m/z 340 and 341 may correspond to loss of a benzyl group (C7H7, 91 Da) from the molecular ion, while the peak at m/z 355 could result from a rearrangement involving the vinyl group (C=C) or partial retention of the phenylalanine side chain. The peaks at m/z 147, 167, and 182 further support sequential fragmentation of the aromatic rings and aliphatic linkers. Notably, the absence of significant peaks above m/z 435 confirms the molecular ion assignment, with no evidence of dimerization or adduct formation. This spectrum reflects the structural complexity of the molecule, with fragmentation pathways dominated by the stability of aromatic systems, the sulfonamide group, and the amide linkage.

This peak confirms the molecular weight calculated from the given formula (C21H21ClN4O2: 396.5 g/mol). The base peak at m/z 397 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Key fragment ions are observed at m/z 341, 221, and 145. The peak at m/z 341 suggests a loss of 56 Da from the molecular ion, consistent with the cleavage of a C4H8 group (likely isobutene) from the isobutyl substituent on the indazole nitrogen. This fragmentation pathway is common for alkyl side chains in aromatic systems. The fragment at m/z 221 represents a significant structural subunit, potentially arising from the indazole-chlorophenyl moiety after cleavage of the pyridine-ester and isobutyl groups. Its high relative abundance implies a stable aromatic or heteroaromatic fragment. The peak at m/z 145 may correspond to a smaller heterocyclic fragment, such as a pyridine-carboxylate derivative, formed by cleavage of the methylene bridge linking the pyridine and indazole rings. Minor peaks at m/z 209, 270, 281, 309, 327, and 365 suggest further decomposition of the molecular ion or secondary fragmentation of primary fragments. These could involve losses of small neutral species like CO, HCl, or hydrocarbon chains. The absence of significant isotope peaks (e.g., at m/z 399) confirms the presence of only one chlorine atom, as expected from the formula.

The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet near 13 ppm, likely corresponding to the amide NH proton, which is strongly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and resonance with the adjacent carbonyl group. A cluster of multiplets between 12–10 ppm suggests the presence of aromatic protons from the benzene ring substituted with the imidazole moiety (n2ccnc2) and the benzamide group. These shifts are consistent with protons in electron-deficient aromatic environments, where deshielding effects from electronegative nitrogen atoms and conjugated systems dominate. A broad peak near 10 ppm may indicate an exchangeable proton, such as the NH of the amide, though its exact position can vary depending on solvent and temperature. The region between 9–8 ppm contains overlapping signals from aromatic protons on the tetralin-derived cyclohexene ring (C1=Cc2ccccc2CCC1), which are slightly upfield compared to the more electron-deficient benzene ring. The doublet of doublets near 5 ppm corresponds to the vinyl proton on the cyclohexene ring (C1=CH), coupling with adjacent aliphatic protons.

In the aliphatic region, two prominent cross-peaks are observed near 3.8–4.0 ppm (^1H) and 55–60 ppm (^13C), consistent with the methoxy (OCH₃) groups attached to the aromatic rings. These peaks reflect the direct coupling between the methyl protons and their respective carbons. The aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm in ^1H and 110–160 ppm in ^13C) exhibits multiple cross-peaks, indicative of the protonated carbons in the benzene, indole, and pyridine rings. For example, the indole moiety (c2c[nH]c3ccccc23) contributes peaks in the 7.0–7.5 ppm (^1H) and 110–130 ppm (^13C) range, corresponding to its aromatic protons and carbons.

A broad, weak band near 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of O-H stretching, potentially from trace moisture or a minor impurity, as the molecule lacks a hydroxyl group. Sharp peaks at ~2950 cm⁻¹ correspond to aliphatic C-H stretching vibrations in the ethyl and methyl substituents. The most prominent absorption at ~1750 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of the ester group, a hallmark of its high dipole moment change during vibration. Additional sharp peaks at ~1600 and 1500 cm⁻¹ arise from aromatic C=C stretching modes in the benzene rings. The region between 1250–1050 cm⁻¹ displays multiple strong absorptions, likely due to C-O stretching vibrations from the ester and ether linkages (Ar-O-R and R-O-C=O), as well as contributions from the methoxy (OCH₃) substituent. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) shows complex patterns typical of aromatic ring deformations and C-H in-plane bending, with distinct peaks at ~1200, 1150, and 1050 cm⁻¹ further supporting the presence of ether and ester functionalities. The absence of significant absorptions near 2200 cm⁻¹ (C≡N or C≡C stretches) and 3300 cm⁻¹ (N-H or O-H stretches) aligns with the molecule’s structure, which lacks nitrile, alkyne, or amine groups. This spectral profile provides clear evidence of the ester, aromatic ether, and aliphatic components in C20H24O4."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 188, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the molecular weight of N-allylphthalimide (calculated: 187.19 g/mol). The base peak at m/z 188 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Key fragment ions are observed at m/z 160, 130, 147, and 77. The peak at m/z 160 suggests a loss of 28 Da (likely CO or C2H4) from the molecular ion, possibly due to cleavage of the allyl group or decarbonylation of one of the phthalimide carbonyl groups. The fragment at m/z 147 corresponds to the phthalimide ion (C8H4NO2+), formed by homolytic cleavage of the N-allyl bond, a common fragmentation pathway for N-substituted phthalimides. The m/z 130 peak may arise from further decomposition of the phthalimide core, potentially involving ring opening or loss of a benzoyl fragment (C7H5O+, 105 Da) followed by rearrangement. The intense peak at m/z 77 is characteristic of the phenyl cation (C6H5+), confirming the aromatic nature of the structure. Additional minor peaks at m/z 105 (benzoyl ion), 115–118, and 146–148 further support the presence of the phthalimide moiety and its typical fragmentation behavior. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 188 excludes dimerization or adduct formation. This fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of N-allylphthalimide, where the allyl group and phthalimide ring contribute distinct diagnostic ions."

The spectrum displays characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups present in this piperidine-derived carboxylic acid. A broad, intense peak centered near 3300 cm⁻¹ is indicative of the O–H stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid group, exhibiting hydrogen-bonding interactions typical of such moieties. Adjacent to this, a sharp, strong absorption at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C=O stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid carbonyl group, consistent with its expected position for a non-conjugated system. In the region between 2850–2950 cm⁻¹, multiple sharp peaks arise from C–H stretching vibrations of the aliphatic CH₂ and CH groups in the piperidine ring and propyl chain. The absence of significant absorption above 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests no free N–H stretching, though the secondary amine (N–H) in the piperidine ring may contribute to weaker, broader absorptions overlapping with the O–H region. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains several diagnostic peaks. A prominent band near 1400 cm⁻¹ likely corresponds to C–N stretching vibrations of the amine, while peaks between 1000–1300 cm⁻¹ may reflect C–O stretching and O–H bending modes of the carboxylic acid. Additional absorptions in the 700–900 cm⁻¹ range could originate from C–H bending deformations in the aliphatic framework. Notably, the spectrum lacks significant absorption in the 2200–2300 cm⁻¹ region, confirming the absence of nitrile or alkyne functional groups. The observed features collectively align with the structural features of O=C(O)CCC1CCCNC1, providing clear evidence for the coexistence of carboxylic acid and piperidine functionalities in this molecule."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances consistent with the structural features of the molecule. The most downfield peak at ~160 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the carbamate group, which is deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent oxygen and nitrogen atoms. Aromatic carbons appear in the 110–140 ppm range, with multiple peaks reflecting the substituted benzene rings. The trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatic ring (c1) exhibits resonances around 130–140 ppm, where the carbon directly bonded to the CF3 group is further deshielded due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine. The second aromatic ring (c2), substituted with a sulfonyl group, shows peaks in the 120–130 ppm region, consistent with the deshielding influence of the sulfone moiety. The tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) contributes a sharp peak at ~28 ppm for the three equivalent methyl carbons and a quaternary carbon resonance at ~70 ppm, which is slightly deshielded due to its attachment to the oxygen atom. The ethylene chain (CH2CH2) in the sulfonamide linker displays peaks at ~45 ppm and ~55 ppm, with the latter likely corresponding to the carbon adjacent to the sulfonamide nitrogen, which experiences deshielding from the electronegative nitrogen and sulfonyl group. Notably, the absence of peaks in the 0–20 ppm range indicates no aliphatic methyl groups beyond the tert-butyl moiety. The sulfonyl groups (S(=O)2) do not directly contribute to carbon resonances but influence the chemical shifts of adjacent carbons. The spectrum confirms the presence of 21 unique carbon environments, with peak multiplicities and intensities aligning with the molecular symmetry and substitution patterns. This analysis supports the structural integrity of the molecule as defined by its SMILES notation and molecular formula."

The spectrum displays characteristic chemical shifts corresponding to the structural features of this compound. The most downfield peak, appearing near 170 ppm, is attributed to the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (C=O), which typically resonates in this region due to its strong deshielding effect. Adjacent to this, a peak around 155 ppm corresponds to the urea carbonyl carbon (C=O) from the dimethylurea moiety, which is slightly upfield due to its amide-like resonance stabilization. Aromatic carbons dominate the 120–150 ppm range, with multiple distinct peaks reflecting the substituted benzene rings. The quaternary aromatic carbons (e.g., the ipso carbon attached to the tetrahydroquinoline nitrogen and the carboxylic acid-substituted carbon) appear as sharp, intense peaks near 140–145 ppm, while the protonated aromatic carbons resonate between 125–135 ppm. The tetrahydroquinoline ring system contributes additional signals: the benzylic carbon adjacent to the nitrogen appears near 50–60 ppm, and the two methyl groups on the quaternary carbon (C2) produce a single peak around 25–30 ppm due to their equivalent chemical environment. In the aliphatic region (0–50 ppm), the N-methyl groups from the dimethylurea and the N-methyl substituent on the aniline ring are observed as distinct peaks. The N-methyl groups in the urea moiety resonate near 35–40 ppm, while the aniline N-methyl group appears slightly upfield (~30 ppm), reflecting differences in their electronic environments. The absence of peaks below 20 ppm confirms the lack of long-chain aliphatic groups in the structure. The spectrum’s peak multiplicity and integration align with the molecular symmetry, particularly in the aromatic and aliphatic regions. For instance, the equivalence of the two methyl groups on C2 of the tetrahydroquinoline ring results in a single resonance. Overall, the chemical shifts and peak assignments are consistent with the proposed structure, validating the presence of functional groups such as the carboxylic acid, urea, aromatic rings, and alkyl substituents. This analysis underscores the utility of C-NMR in elucidating molecular frameworks through characteristic resonance patterns."

The most prominent peak at ~150 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group, a characteristic feature of carbamate functionalities. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~120 ppm likely arises from the quaternary carbon in the Boc group, which is deshielded due to its attachment to electronegative oxygen atoms. A cluster of peaks between 100–110 ppm may indicate carbons in the bicyclic framework, potentially influenced by ring strain or proximity to heteroatoms.

The tert-butyl group of the Boc moiety contributes to the peak at ~25 ppm, consistent with its shielded, highly symmetric structure. The spectrum’s complexity highlights the molecule’s bicyclic architecture and functional group diversity, with clear differentiation between sp³-hybridized carbons in the rings, the polar Boc group, and the hydroxymethyl substituent.

This fragment is characteristic of phenolic compounds, where the positive charge is stabilized by resonance in the six-membered ring. The molecular ion peak [M]+ is observed at m/z 222, consistent with the molecular weight of C14H22O2 (calculated as 14 × 12 + 22 × 1 + 2 × 16 = 222).

Additional significant peaks include m/z 108, 119, 121, 133, 95, 91, and 79. The peak at m/z 108 likely represents a fragment retaining the hydroxyl group alongside a partially saturated ring structure. Peaks at m/z 119 and 121 may arise from cleavage of the aliphatic chain, generating oxygen-containing fragments such as C8H11O+ (119) and C8H13O+ (121), which could result from homolytic bond breaking in the octanol side chain. The m/z 133 peak may correspond to a C9H13O+ fragment, formed by loss of a C5H9 group from the alkyl chain. Lower-mass peaks at m/z 95, 91, and 79 are indicative of smaller aromatic fragments. The m/z 95 peak likely represents a hydroxylated benzene ring (C6H7O+), while m/z 91 corresponds to the classic benzyl cation (C7H7+), suggesting partial degradation of the aromatic system. The m/z 79 peak (C6H7+) may arise from further dehydrogenation of the benzyl ion. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern aligns with the structure of a phenolic compound bearing a long aliphatic chain. The dominance of the m/z 107 peak underscores the stability of the aromatic tropylium ion, while the distribution of aliphatic fragments reflects the molecule’s extended hydrocarbon backbone.

This region is free of broad O-H absorptions, confirming the absence of hydroxyl groups. The aromatic C-H stretching vibrations of the phenyl and pyrimidine rings manifest as sharp peaks between 3000–3100 cm⁻¹, while the triazole ring (-n2nccn2) contributes to the complex fingerprint region below 1500 cm⁻¹. In the mid-infrared region (1000–1500 cm⁻¹), multiple sharp peaks are observed, including those near 1300 cm⁻¹ and 1150 cm⁻¹, which may correspond to C-N stretching in the pyrimidine and triazole rings, as well as S-C stretching from the methylthio (SC) substituent. The strong absorption near 700 cm⁻¹ is consistent with out-of-plane C-H bending vibrations of the aromatic systems.

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks that correlate with the structural features of 2-hydrazino-6-iodopyridine. The most prominent signal appears as a sharp singlet at approximately 6.0 ppm, which is unusually upfield for aromatic protons but consistent with the influence of the electron-donating hydrazine (-NHNH2) group at position 2 of the pyridine ring. This substituent increases electron density on the ring, shielding the adjacent protons. The singlet likely corresponds to the proton at position 4, which is symmetrically positioned between the iodine (position 6) and hydrazine (position 2) substituents, resulting in minimal coupling. Two additional peaks at ~10.0 ppm and ~12.0 ppm are observed, both characteristic of exchangeable protons from the hydrazine moiety. The peak at 12.0 ppm, appearing as a broad singlet, is attributed to the NH proton directly attached to the pyridine ring (N-H), which is deshielded due to hydrogen bonding or ring current effects. The peak at 10.0 ppm, slightly less downfield, likely corresponds to the NH2 group, which may exhibit splitting due to coupling with adjacent protons or solvent interactions. The absence of signals in the 7.0–9.0 ppm range, typical for unsubstituted pyridine protons, further supports the strong shielding effect of the hydrazine group. The iodine atom at position 6, while electronegative, does not significantly deshield nearby protons, possibly due to its larger atomic size and weaker inductive effects compared to smaller halogens like fluorine or chlorine. Overall, the spectrum reflects the interplay of electron-donating (hydrazine) and weakly electron-withdrawing (iodine) substituents on the pyridine ring, with distinct chemical shifts for aromatic and exchangeable protons.

The chlorine substituent induces deshielding, shifting these protons downfield, while the para symmetry results in a single resonance despite the substitution pattern. A sharp peak at ~5.0 ppm (intensity ~0.07) is attributed to the two bridgehead protons on the cyclopropane ring, which are deshielded due to their proximity to both the aromatic ring and the adjacent aminomethyl group. The cyclopropane ring’s strained geometry creates distinct electronic environments for its protons, leading to additional resonances at ~2.8 ppm (intensity ~0.03) and ~2.5 ppm (intensity ~0.02), likely representing the four non-bridgehead protons on the ring. These upfield shifts reflect the shielding effects typical of cyclopropane systems, though coupling interactions may split these signals into multiplets. The aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2) appears as a moderately intense peak at ~3.5 ppm (intensity ~0.03), consistent with the deshielding effect of the adjacent nitrogen atom. The NH2 protons are not distinctly visible, likely due to rapid exchange with residual solvent or broadening from hydrogen bonding. Integration of the peaks aligns with the molecular formula: the aromatic singlet (4H), bridgehead cyclopropane protons (2H), aminomethyl group (2H), and remaining cyclopropane protons (4H) account for all 12 protons. The absence of additional peaks confirms the absence of impurities or unexpected structural features. This spectrum exemplifies how electronic effects, molecular symmetry, and ring strain influence chemical shifts and splitting patterns in H-NMR analysis."

The most downfield peak at ~10.5 ppm corresponds to a highly deshielded proton, likely the vinylic proton at the C1 position of the dihydropyridine ring, adjacent to both the electron-withdrawing sulfonate group (OSO2CF3) and the conjugated double bond. This extreme downfield shift reflects strong deshielding from the sulfonate’s inductive effects and the ring’s electronic environment. Aromatic protons from the benzyl group (Cc2ccccc2) appear as a multiplet between 7.2–7.5 ppm, integrating to five hydrogens, typical of a monosubstituted benzene ring. The benzyl methylene group (CH2 attached to nitrogen) resonates as a singlet near 4.0 ppm, reflecting its proximity to the electronegative nitrogen and the aromatic ring. The sulfonate-bearing carbon (C1) lacks a proton due to substitution, but the adjacent C2 position in the dihydropyridine ring exhibits a proton at ~3.0 ppm, split into a doublet by coupling with neighboring ring protons. The piperidine ring’s methylene groups (CH2) appear between 2.0–2.5 ppm, with splitting patterns influenced by their position relative to nitrogen and the double bond. The butanoyl side chain (CCCC=O) contributes signals at ~2.1 ppm (triplet, CH2 adjacent to carbonyl), ~1.5 ppm (multiplet, middle CH2), and ~0.9 ppm (triplet, terminal CH3). The carbonyl group itself does not produce a direct signal in H-NMR but influences the chemical shift of nearby protons. Notably, the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) in the sulfonate does not appear in the H-NMR spectrum, as fluorine nuclei are not detected in proton NMR. However, its electron-withdrawing effects contribute to the deshielding of nearby protons. Overall, the spectrum’s features—downfield vinylic proton, aromatic multiplet, benzyl methylene singlet, and aliphatic chain resonances—align with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of distinct functional groups and their spatial relationships."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C4H5NOS (SMILES: OCc1cnsc1). The spectrum displays four distinct peaks corresponding to the four unique carbon environments in the molecule. The peak at approximately 60 ppm is attributed to the hydroxymethyl (-CH2OH) group attached to the thiazole ring, reflecting its aliphatic nature and deshielding by the electronegative oxygen atom. Three additional peaks in the aromatic region (110–170 ppm) correspond to the carbons within the thiazole ring. The peak near 110 ppm likely represents the ring carbon adjacent to the sulfur atom, which experiences moderate deshielding due to sulfur's inductive effects. The peak at ~130 ppm corresponds to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen atom in the ring, where the electronegative nitrogen induces greater deshielding. The most downfield peak at ~170 ppm is unusual for a thiazole system but may arise from a quaternary carbon or a resonance effect involving conjugation within the aromatic ring, though further analysis would be required to confirm this assignment. The absence of peaks in the carbonyl region (170–220 ppm) confirms the lack of ketone or carboxylic acid functionalities, consistent with the provided structure. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected chemical environments of a hydroxymethyl-substituted thiazole derivative."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C10H17NO3 (SMILES: CC(C(=O)O)N1CCCCCCC1=O)). The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peaks, observed near 170–175 ppm, are characteristic of carbonyl carbons. These include the carboxylic acid carbonyl (COOH) and the lactam carbonyl (C=O in the seven-membered ring), which typically resonate in this region due to their high electron-withdrawing nature. A prominent peak around 160 ppm may also correspond to the lactam carbonyl, influenced by the ring's electronic environment. In the mid-field region (50–60 ppm), a peak near 55 ppm is attributed to the methine carbon (CH) directly bonded to the nitrogen atom in the ring. This carbon experiences deshielding due to the adjacent electronegative nitrogen. The methyl group (CH3) attached to the methine carbon appears as a peak near 20 ppm, consistent with its aliphatic nature. The spectrum also shows multiple peaks in the 20–40 ppm range, corresponding to the methylene (CH2) groups in the seven-membered lactam ring. The presence of several distinct peaks in this region suggests conformational rigidity or asymmetry in the ring, leading to non-equivalent CH2 environments. For example, the CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl (α to C=O) typically resonates slightly downfield (closer to 40 ppm), while others appear upfield (20–30 ppm). Notably, the absence of peaks above 180 ppm or below 0 ppm confirms the lack of highly deshielded or shielded carbons, such as those in aromatic systems or metal-bound environments. The integration of peak intensities aligns with the molecular formula, reflecting one carboxylic acid, one lactam, seven aliphatic carbons (six CH2 and one CH3), and one methine carbon. This spectral profile is consistent with the structural features of CC(C(=O)O)N1CCCCCCC1=O, providing clear evidence of its functional groups and carbon connectivity."

The base peak (highest relative abundance) appears at m/z 149, suggesting a highly stable fragment ion. Prominent peaks at m/z 249 and 251, with nearly equal intensity, indicate the presence of chlorine isotopes (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl) in the molecular structure. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 173, 175 (chlorine isotope pair), 211, and 277, with lower-intensity peaks distributed across the m/z range 100–277. The molecular ion peak at 295 confirms the molecular weight of C14H8Cl2O3 (calculated: 295.12 g/mol). The intense fragment at m/z 149 likely corresponds to a dichlorinated benzoyl cation ([C7H3Cl2O]+), formed via cleavage of the bond between the two aromatic rings. The 249/251 peak pair suggests a loss of COOH (45 Da) from the molecular ion, consistent with the carboxylic acid group in the SMILES structure.

A prominent singlet at approximately 3.0 ppm (integration ~5H) likely represents the combined signals of the methylthio group (S-CH3, ~2.1 ppm) and the methylene group (CH2, ~3.7 ppm), which may overlap due to similar chemical shifts. The S-CH3 group typically appears as a singlet in the 2.0–2.5 ppm range, while the CH2 adjacent to sulfur is deshielded, appearing slightly downfield. A triplet or doublet of doublets near 6.8–7.2 ppm (integration ~1H) corresponds to the aromatic proton at position 4 on the benzene ring. This proton is strongly influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of three fluorine atoms (positions 3, 5, and 6) and the amino group (position 2), causing significant deshielding. The splitting pattern arises from coupling with neighboring fluorine nuclei (¹H-¹⁹F coupling constants typically range 5–50 Hz). A broad, low-intensity peak near 5.5–6.5 ppm (integration ~2H) is consistent with the NH2 group, which often exhibits variable chemical shifts due to hydrogen bonding and rapid exchange with solvent protons. The absence of coupling between the NH2 and adjacent protons suggests rapid proton exchange, leading to a broad singlet. A minor peak at ~10 ppm (integration ~1H) may indicate trace impurities or residual solvent (e.g., DMSO-d6 or water), as no protons in the target molecule are expected in this region. The fluorine substituents further reduce aromatic proton density, shifting remaining signals downfield compared to unsubstituted benzene (~7.3 ppm). Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of the methylthio, methylene, aromatic, and amino groups, as well as the electronic effects of fluorine substitution."

The isotopic pattern at m/z 253 shows a minor M+1 peak (approximately 10% relative abundance), aligning with the natural abundance of ¹³C in a molecule with 15 carbon atoms. The absence of significant halogen-related isotopic signatures confirms the lack of Cl or Br in the structure.

The cyclohexyl protons show moderate dispersion due to conformational flexibility, while the CH₂ group near the sulfur atom (in the thiazole) appears slightly upfield (~2.5 ppm in ¹H). 4. **Thiazole ring (¹H ~7 ppm, ¹³C ~120–140 ppm):** The thiazole heterocycle (sc(C)nc) contributes cross-peaks in the aromatic region, with the proton at the 4-position of the ring appearing as a distinct resonance. The spectrum confirms the connectivity of the molecule, including the thiazole core, substituted phenyl rings, cyclohexyl group, and carboxylic acid functionality. The absence of additional peaks suggests high purity and no significant decomposition.

Additional significant fragments include m/z 81 and 98, which correspond to the hexynyl chain (C6H9) and the hexynyl-oxygen group (C6H9O), respectively, indicating scission of the O–C bond in the alkoxy linker. The peak at m/z 162 may represent the phthalimide-oxygen fragment (C8H4NO3), while m/z 164 could reflect an isotopic variant. Peaks at m/z 190 and 226 may arise from partial degradation or loss of small neutral molecules (e.g., H2O or CO), though their exact origins require further structural analysis. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern aligns with the compound’s structural features, including the phthalimide ring and the terminal alkyne-terminated alkoxy chain, demonstrating characteristic cleavages at labile bonds and stabilization of aromatic or conjugated fragments."

The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 338, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 337 g/mol. A significant fragment at m/z 321 (338–17) suggests loss of ammonia (NH3), likely originating from the primary amine group (-NH2) attached to the CH2 linker. Another major fragment at m/z 253 (338–85) indicates cleavage of the trifluoromethoxy group (-OCF3, mass 85), a common fragmentation pathway for aryl ethers. A minor peak at m/z 322 (338–16) may correspond to the loss of an oxygen atom or a rearrangement involving the pyrrolidine ring (N2CCCC2), though further structural analysis would be required to confirm this. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 200 suggests limited fragmentation of the core aromatic systems. The observed mass transitions align with the structural features of the molecule, including the pyridine ring, benzylamine moiety, and electron-withdrawing OCF3 substituent. The spectrum reflects the stability of the aromatic framework and the susceptibility of the amine and ether functionalities to fragmentation under ionization conditions."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C18H20ClFO3 (SMILES: O=C(O)c1cc(Cl)c(OCC2C3CC4CC(C3)CC2C4)cc1F). The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates 1H and 13C chemical shifts for directly bonded proton-carbon pairs, providing insights into the molecular structure. The x-axis represents 1H chemical shifts (ppm), spanning ~14 to -2 ppm, while the y-axis represents 13C shifts (ppm), ranging from 0 to 200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (1H: 6–8 ppm; 13C: 120–160 ppm):** A cluster of peaks in this region corresponds to protons and carbons on the substituted benzene ring. The presence of Cl and F substituents induces deshielding effects, shifting adjacent protons and carbons downfield. For instance, the peak near 7.5 ppm (1H) and 150 ppm (13C) likely represents a proton on a carbon ortho to both Cl and F, which are strong electron-withdrawing groups. The fluorine’s coupling to adjacent protons may also contribute to peak splitting patterns, though HSQC typically collapses couplings into single cross-peaks. 2. **Oxymethylene Group (1H: ~4.5 ppm; 13C: ~65 ppm):** A distinct peak at ~4.5 ppm (1H) and ~65 ppm (13C) corresponds to the CH2 group in the –OCH2– linker connecting the adamantyl moiety to the aromatic ring. The oxygen atom deshields the carbon, shifting its resonance downfield compared to aliphatic carbons. 3. **Adamantyl Moiety (1H: 1.5–2.5 ppm; 13C: 30–40 ppm):** Multiple peaks in this region arise from the rigid, cage-like adamantyl structure. The symmetric environment of the CH and CH2 groups in adamantane produces characteristic chemical shifts. For example, the bridgehead carbons (quaternary) typically resonate near 35–40 ppm, while methylene carbons appear at lower shifts (25–30 ppm). 4. **Carboxylic Acid Group (1H: ~12 ppm; 13C: ~170 ppm):** A peak near 12 ppm (1H) and 170 ppm (13C) is consistent with the –COOH group. The acidic proton is highly deshielded, while the carbonyl carbon appears in the typical range for carboxylic acids. 5. **Fluorine Substitution Effects:** The fluorine atom at the aromatic ring’s para position to the carboxylic acid induces a strong deshielding effect on adjacent carbons and protons. This is evident in the downfield shifts of correlated peaks in the aromatic region compared to unsubstituted systems. The spectrum’s resolution allows clear differentiation of aliphatic, aromatic, and functional group environments. The adamantyl group’s rigid structure and the electron-withdrawing substituents (Cl, F, –COOH) create distinct chemical shift patterns, aiding in structural assignment. This HSQC data, combined with the molecular formula and SMILES, confirms the presence of the adamantyl ether linkage, substituted aromatic ring, and carboxylic acid functionality."

The spectrum displays characteristic chemical shifts consistent with the aromatic and aliphatic carbon environments in this conjugated system. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at ~40 ppm, corresponding to the two equivalent methyl carbons of the dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2) group, which appears downfield due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent nitrogen. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks reflect the complex substitution pattern. A doublet at ~120 ppm (J ≈ 20 Hz) arises from the fluorinated aromatic carbons (C-F coupling), while peaks at ~130–140 ppm correspond to the pyridine ring carbons and non-fluorinated phenyl carbons. The quaternary carbon of the pyridine ring appears as a singlet near 145 ppm, deshielded by the electronegative nitrogen. The absence of signals above 160 ppm confirms no carbonyl or highly deshielded sp² carbons are present. The spectrum’s simplicity in the aliphatic region (no peaks below 30 ppm) aligns with the molecule’s lack of aliphatic protons, while the symmetry of the dimethylamino group and fluorinated phenyl rings reduces the number of distinct carbon environments. Integration ratios and peak multiplicities further support the proposed structure, with fluorine-induced splitting patterns providing additional confirmation of the substitution pattern on the aromatic rings."

A broad, strong absorption band centered near 3300 cm⁻¹ is indicative of an O–H stretching vibration, consistent with the hydroxyl group in the molecule. Sharp peaks around 2900 cm⁻¹ correspond to C–H stretching vibrations from the aliphatic carbon framework, including both the cyclohexyl group (C2CCCCC2) and the ethyl chain in the morpholine-like ring. A prominent peak near 1000 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the C–O stretching vibration of the alcohol group. Additionally, a strong, sharp peak at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹ likely arises from C–N stretching vibrations in the tertiary amine moiety, though its position is slightly higher than typical C–N stretches (usually 1000–1250 cm⁻¹), possibly due to ring strain or conjugation effects. The absence of peaks above 3500 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of N–H or free O–H groups, while the lack of absorptions near 1700 cm⁻¹ (if no carbonyl is present) aligns with the molecular formula. The spectrum also shows minor peaks between 1300–1500 cm⁻¹, which may correspond to C–H bending vibrations or ring deformations. Overall, the IR data supports the presence of hydroxyl, tertiary amine, and saturated hydrocarbon functionalities in the structure."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating 1H and 13C chemical shifts for directly bonded proton-carbon pairs. The 1H dimension (x-axis) spans ~14 to -2 ppm, while the 13C dimension (y-axis) spans ~0 to -200 ppm, with peaks appearing as black dots. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (1H: 6–10 ppm; 13C: -100 to -150 ppm):** - A cluster of peaks in this region corresponds to protonated aromatic carbons in the imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine core. The electron-withdrawing effects of adjacent nitrogen atoms and the bromine substituent deshield these nuclei, shifting signals downfield. The bromine at position 3 of the imidazole ring likely induces further deshielding in nearby protons and carbons, contributing to the spread of shifts. 2. **Aliphatic Region (1H: 2–4 ppm; 13C: -40 to -60 ppm):** - Peaks here correlate with the dimethylaminoethyl side chain. The N(CH3)2 group’s methyl protons appear as high-intensity signals near 2.5 ppm (1H), paired with carbons near -50 ppm (13C), consistent with tertiary alkyl carbons. The CH2 groups adjacent to nitrogen exhibit slightly deshielded shifts due to inductive effects. 3. **Anomalous Shifts:** - A peak near 10 ppm (1H) and -120 ppm (13C) likely arises from a proton on a carbon adjacent to both nitrogen and bromine, reflecting strong deshielding. Such extreme shifts are characteristic of highly electron-deficient environments. 4. **Signal Intensity and Multiplicity:** - The spectrum lacks splitting patterns typical of 1H-1H coupling, as HSQC isolates direct 1H-13C correlations. The number of distinct cross-peaks suggests four to five unique protonated carbons, aligning with the molecular structure’s aromatic and aliphatic components. This HSQC spectrum effectively maps the connectivity between protons and carbons in the molecule, highlighting the influence of heteroatoms and halogen substitution on chemical shifts. The observed features confirm the presence of both aromatic and aliphatic domains, with the imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine core dominating the downfield region."

The spectrum displays several key peaks that correlate with the structural features of the molecule. The molecular ion peak appears at m/z 228, confirming the molecular weight of the compound. A prominent base peak at m/z 155 suggests a stable fragment resulting from cleavage of the amide bond, likely retaining the thiophene-thioether moiety (C7H9NS2, calculated m/z 155.0). This fragment dominates the spectrum due to resonance stabilization from the aromatic thiophene ring. Additional significant peaks include m/z 210 (M-18), indicative of water loss, possibly from intramolecular rearrangement involving the amide group. The peak at m/z 172 (M-56) may arise from the loss of a propionyl group (C3H5O), consistent with cleavage adjacent to the carbonyl. Peaks at m/z 129 and 123 correspond to fragments containing the thiophene ring with varying substituents, such as C5H5S2 (129) and C4H3S2 (123), reflecting stepwise degradation of the heterocyclic structure. Smaller peaks at m/z 142, 138, and 156 suggest minor rearrangements or secondary fragmentations, potentially involving sulfur migration or ring-opening events. The presence of multiple sulfur atoms is supported by the characteristic isotope patterns (not explicitly labeled here but implied by the molecular formula). Lower-m/z peaks (85–106) likely represent small hydrocarbon fragments or sulfur-containing subunits, such as C3H5S (89) or C4H5S (97), which are common in thiophene derivatives. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the proposed structure, emphasizing the stability of the thiophene-thioether core and the lability of the amide side chain. This spectrum provides clear evidence for the molecular framework and serves as a diagnostic tool for identifying structural motifs in sulfur-rich heterocycles."

The most prominent signal appears as a singlet at approximately 7.5 ppm, which corresponds to the five aromatic protons of the phenyl group directly attached to the sulfonate moiety (OS(=O)(=O)c2ccccc2). This group experiences strong deshielding due to the electron-withdrawing sulfonate substituent, shifting its protons downfield. A second aromatic region at ~7.0 ppm, appearing as a multiplet, integrates to four protons from the para-substituted benzene ring (c1ccc(OS(=O)(=O)...)cc1), where the substituents (S and OSO2Ph) create two distinct sets of equivalent protons (ortho and meta to the substituents). A singlet at ~3.5 ppm is attributed to the two protons of the CH2 group adjacent to the sulfur atom (C#CCS-CH2-). This signal is deshielded due to the electronegativity of sulfur and the adjacent triple bond. The terminal alkyne proton (C#C-H) resonates as a singlet at ~2.5 ppm, consistent with its characteristic chemical shift range. The absence of splitting for this peak confirms no coupling with neighboring protons, as the triple bond lacks adjacent hydrogens.

The ¹H chemical shifts range from 14 to -2 ppm, while the ¹³C shifts span 0 to 200 ppm. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (¹H: 7.0–8.5 ppm; ¹³C: 120–160 ppm)**: - Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to the fluorinated benzene ring and pyridine moiety. The fluorine substituent on the benzene ring induces deshielding, shifting adjacent protons and carbons downfield. For example, the proton at ~8.0 ppm correlates with a carbon near 160 ppm, likely the carbon ortho to fluorine. The pyridine ring’s protons (e.g., ~7.5–8.2 ppm) show correlations with carbons in the 130–150 ppm range, consistent with aromatic nitrogen-containing systems. 2. **Aliphatic Region (¹H: 1.0–4.5 ppm; ¹³C: 20–70 ppm)**: - Peaks at ~4.0–4.5 ppm (¹H) correlate with carbons at ~60–65 ppm, assignable to the OCH₂ group of the ethoxycarbonyl side chain. - The isopropyl ester group (O(C)C) exhibits cross-peaks at ~1.2 ppm (¹H) and ~22 ppm (¹³C) for the methyl groups, with a quaternary carbon at ~68 ppm (no HSQC signal). - The piperidine ring (CCNCC) shows protons at ~2.0–3.5 ppm correlating with carbons at ~25–55 ppm, reflecting its aliphatic nature. 3. **Thioether Group (¹H: ~2.5 ppm; ¹³C: ~30 ppm)**: - A distinct cross-peak at ~2.5 ppm (¹H) and ~30 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methylthio (S-CH₃) group, a hallmark of the thioether functionality. 4. **Fluorine Effects**: - The fluorine substituent on the benzene ring causes splitting or broadening of adjacent proton signals (e.g., ~7.8 ppm), though HSQC typically resolves these as single cross-peaks due to its focus on direct ¹H-¹³C correlations. 5. **Absence of Carbonyl Peaks**: - No cross-peaks are observed above 170 ppm (¹³C), consistent with the lack of aldehyde/ketone carbons. The ester carbonyl (C=O) at ~155–165 ppm is not detected in HSQC, as it lacks directly attached protons.

The chemical shift of this carbon reflects its attachment to an oxygen atom (C–O), consistent with the ether linkage in the structure. 2. **Oxymethylene Region (3.5–4.5 ppm, 50–70 ppm):** A distinct cross-peak at ~4.0 ppm (¹H) and 60 ppm (¹³C) arises from the CH₂ group adjacent to the carboxylic acid (–CH₂COOH), where the downfield ¹H shift indicates deshielding by the electronegative oxygen. 3. **Aromatic Region (6.5–8.5 ppm, 110–150 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks in this area correspond to aromatic protons and their attached carbons. The broad distribution of ¹³C shifts (120–140 ppm) reflects the heteroaromatic pyridine and benzene rings, with the oxadiazole ring contributing to the high-field ¹³C signals (~130 ppm). 4. **Fluorine-Substituted Aromatics (7–8 ppm, 140–150 ppm):** Peaks near 7.8 ppm (¹H) and 145 ppm (¹³C) are attributed to protons and carbons ortho to the CF₃ groups, where strong electron-withdrawing effects cause significant deshielding. 5. **Carbonyl Region (Not Directly Observed):** The carboxylic acid carbon (~170 ppm) is absent in HSQC since it lacks directly bonded protons, but its presence is inferred from the oxymethylene signal.

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule’s structural complexity. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (120–150 ppm):** Multiple peaks in this range correspond to the aromatic carbons of the substituted benzene rings. The signals at ~130–140 ppm likely arise from the electron-rich aromatic carbons adjacent to the oxygenated substituents (e.g., the methoxy and thiazolidinedione-linked side chain), while peaks near 120 ppm may represent less substituted or meta-positioned aromatic carbons. 2. **Carbonyl Region (~170–180 ppm):** A prominent peak at ~175 ppm is consistent with the carbonyl carbons of the thiazolidinedione ring (C=O), which are highly deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen and sulfur atoms. 3. **Aliphatic Region (0–60 ppm):** - Peaks between 50–60 ppm likely correspond to the quaternary carbons in the tetralin-like bicyclic system (e.g., the C(C)(C) groups). - Signals near 30–40 ppm may represent the methylene (CH₂) and methine (CH) carbons in the aliphatic backbone, including the isopropyl group (C(C)O) and the cyclohexyl-like ring. - The methyl groups (CH₃) attached to the aromatic rings and aliphatic framework appear as sharp peaks below 25 ppm, with the most upfield signal (~20 ppm) likely from the terminal methyls of the tert-butyl-like substituents. 4. **Heteroatom-Adjacent Carbons:** The resonance near 70–80 ppm could correspond to the carbon bonded to the oxygen in the ether linkage (C–O–C), reflecting moderate deshielding. The spectrum’s dispersion and intensity distribution align with the molecule’s symmetry and substitution pattern. For instance, the equivalence of certain methyl groups in the tert-butyl and tetralin systems likely reduces the number of observed peaks, while the thiazolidinedione ring’s rigid structure produces distinct carbonyl and thiocarbonyl signals.

The oxazole ring's methylene group (CO[C@@H]3...) and the CH2 group adjacent to the nitrogen (CN(CC(=O)O)...) are likely represented here, with shifts influenced by the electronegativity of oxygen and nitrogen. 4. **Aliphatic Region (10–50 ppm):** Several peaks in this range reflect the cyclohexane ring ([C@H]3CCC[C@H]...) and methyl groups (Cc1ccc... and c(C)o2). The methyl carbons (CH3) typically appear upfield (~20 ppm), while the cyclohexane carbons exhibit intermediate shifts due to their saturated nature. The spectrum’s peak multiplicity and intensity align with the molecular symmetry and substitution patterns. For instance, the benzene ring’s para-substitution (from the oxazole and methyl groups) may reduce the number of distinct aromatic peaks due to equivalent environments. Similarly, the cyclohexane ring’s chair conformation likely results in diastereotopic carbons, contributing to the observed splitting. Overall, the C-NMR spectrum provides a detailed map of the molecule’s carbon framework, with shifts correlating to functional groups and structural motifs in the SMILES notation. The data confirm the presence of aromatic, heterocyclic, carbonyl, and aliphatic components, as expected for C28H34N2O4."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C14H32N2O4 (SMILES: OCCN(CCO)CCCCCCN(CCO)CCO). The spectrum displays several distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–7 ppm, reflecting the molecule's structural features. The most prominent peaks occur at approximately 2.5 ppm, 3.5–4.0 ppm, and 5.5–6.5 ppm. The peak near 2.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene protons (-CH2-) adjacent to the nitrogen atoms in the diethanolamine groups. These protons are deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitrogen, shifting their resonance downfield. The broad multiplet at 3.5–4.0 ppm arises from the methylene protons (-CH2-) directly bonded to oxygen atoms in the -OCH2CH2- segments of the diethanolamine side chains. These protons experience strong deshielding from the electronegative oxygen, placing them in this characteristic region. The peaks at 5.5–6.5 ppm are less intense and may represent residual solvent signals (e.g., water or DMSO) or impurities, as the target molecule lacks protons in highly deshielded environments. The absence of aromatic or alkenyl protons (typically observed above 6 ppm) confirms the molecule’s saturated nature. The hexamethylene linker (-CH2-)6- contributes to the weaker signals between 1.0–2.0 ppm, though these are partially obscured by the stronger peaks from the nitrogen-adjacent protons. The molecule’s symmetry, as reflected in its SMILES notation, results in equivalent chemical environments for corresponding protons on both diethanolamine arms, simplifying the splitting patterns. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected proton environments of a symmetrical polyether-diamine structure, with clear evidence of deshielded protons near electronegative heteroatoms and a predominantly aliphatic backbone."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing insights into the molecular structure. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (¹H 6–8 ppm, ¹³C 100–160 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks dominate this area, corresponding to the quinoline core and chlorophenyl substituent. The quinoline ring (n1) exhibits distinct correlations for protons at positions 5–8 (¹H ~7–8 ppm) and their attached carbons (¹³C ~120–140 ppm). The chlorophenyl group (c3ccc(Cl)cc3) contributes peaks at ¹H ~7.3–7.6 ppm and ¹³C ~128–135 ppm, reflecting its electron-withdrawing Cl substituent. 2. **Aliphatic Region (¹H 1–3 ppm, ¹³C 20–40 ppm):** Cross-peaks here arise from the ethyl group (CCc1...), tert-butoxy methyls (OC(C)(C)C), and the quinoline methyl substituent (c(C)cc2n1). The ethyl group shows correlations for CH₂ (¹H ~2.8 ppm, ¹³C ~25 ppm) and CH₃ (¹H ~1.3 ppm, ¹³C ~12 ppm). The tert-butoxy group appears as a singlet-like cluster (¹H ~1.2 ppm, ¹³C ~28 ppm), while the quinoline methyl group is observed at ¹H ~2.4 ppm and ¹³C ~20 ppm. 3. **Downfield Proton Region (¹H 10–12 ppm, ¹³C 120–140 ppm):** A distinct cross-peak at ¹H ~11.5 ppm and ¹³C ~130 ppm likely corresponds to the quinoline C2 proton, deshielded by the adjacent nitrogen atom. This feature is characteristic of heteroaromatic systems. 4. **Carboxylic Acid Proton (¹H ~10–12 ppm):** While the carboxylic acid proton (C(=O)O) is expected in this region, HSQC does not show a correlation for its carbon (¹³C ~170–180 ppm) due to the lack of direct C–H bonding. The spectrum confirms the presence of aromatic, aliphatic, and heteroaromatic components, aligning with the SMILES notation. Substitution patterns (e.g., Cl on the phenyl ring, tert-butoxy group) influence chemical shifts, with electron-withdrawing effects deshielding adjacent nuclei.

A broad, moderate-intensity peak near 3500 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O–H stretch, likely from the hydroxylamine (–C(=O)NO) moiety. Adjacent sharp peaks around 3300 cm⁻¹ may indicate N–H stretching vibrations from the amide or hydroxylamine groups. The region between 3000–2800 cm⁻¹ shows multiple sharp peaks, consistent with C–H stretching vibrations from aromatic rings (3000–3100 cm⁻¹) and aliphatic C–H bonds in the isopropyl group and methylene linkers (2800–2950 cm⁻¹). A prominent, sharp peak near 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching of the lactam (cyclic amide) ring, while a slightly weaker band near 1650 cm⁻¹ may arise from the hydroxylamine carbonyl. Additional peaks in the 1600–1450 cm⁻¹ range reflect aromatic C=C stretching vibrations from the benzene rings. The spectrum also displays distinct absorptions in the fingerprint region (1300–600 cm⁻¹), including C–N stretching vibrations near 1300 cm⁻¹ and C–O–C stretching from the ether linkage (Ar–O–CH₂–) around 1200–1100 cm⁻¹. Weak out-of-plane C–H bending modes near 700–800 cm⁻¹ further support the presence of substituted aromatic rings.

Sharp, intense peaks at 1710 cm⁻¹ and 1695 cm⁻¹ are consistent with carbonyl (C=O) stretching in the tert-butyl carbamate (Boc) protecting group. The sulfone group (S(=O)₂) produces two strong, sharp absorptions at 1320 cm⁻¹ and 1160 cm⁻¹, corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric S=O stretching modes, respectively. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), multiple peaks reflect complex vibrational modes of the aromatic rings and C-F bonds.

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides a two-dimensional correlation between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the molecule. The x-axis (¹H chemical shift) spans 14 to -2 ppm, while the y-axis (¹³C chemical shift) ranges from 0 to 200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aliphatic region (1H: 0–3 ppm; ¹³C: 10–50 ppm):** A cluster of peaks in this region corresponds to the propyl chain (CCCN) and methylene groups adjacent to the thioether sulfur (S-CH₂). The terminal methyl group of the propyl chain appears as a distinct cross-peak near ~0.9 ppm (¹H) and ~12 ppm (¹³C), typical for aliphatic methyl carbons. Methylene protons (CH₂) in the propyl chain and piperazine ring (N-CH₂) resonate between 1.5–3.0 ppm (¹H), with corresponding carbons at ~20–35 ppm (¹³C), reflecting their deshielding by adjacent nitrogen and sulfur atoms. 2. **Aromatic/olefinic region (1H: 6–8 ppm; ¹³C: 100–150 ppm):** Several intense peaks in this region arise from aromatic protons and their attached carbons in the pyrimidine ring (nc1nc2c1SCC2) and the substituted phenyl ring (c3ccc(C#N)cc3). The aromatic protons on the phenyl ring, particularly those ortho to the nitrile group (C#N), appear downfield (~7.5–8.0 ppm, ¹H) due to electron-withdrawing effects, with corresponding carbons near ~120–140 ppm (¹³C). The pyrimidine ring protons (e.g., H-4 and H-6) exhibit shifts at ~6.5–7.2 ppm (¹H) and ~100–120 ppm (¹³C), consistent with their heteroaromatic environment. 3. **Nitrile-adjacent carbon (¹³C: ~115 ppm):** The nitrile group (C#N) itself is not directly observed in HSQC (as it lacks a bonded proton), but the ipso carbon of the phenyl ring (attached to the nitrile) appears as a quaternary carbon in the ¹³C dimension (~135 ppm) and is indirectly inferred from the aromatic proton pattern. 4. **High-field aromatic carbons (¹³C: 50–100 ppm):** Peaks in this range likely correspond to methine carbons (CH) in the pyrimidine ring or piperazine-adjacent carbons, which are deshielded by nitrogen but not fully aromatic. The spectrum confirms the presence of protonated carbons across all structural motifs, including aliphatic, heteroaromatic, and aromatic systems. The absence of peaks in regions typical for carbonyl carbons (¹³C: 160–200 ppm) aligns with the molecule’s lack of carbonyl groups. Overall, the HSQC data supports the proposed structure, validating the connectivity of protonated carbons and their chemical environments in this thioether-containing heterocycle."

The spectrum displays a dominant molecular ion peak at m/z 191, which corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the molecular weight of 190.19 g/mol for C11H10O3. The base peak at m/z 191 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Notable fragment ions are observed at m/z 176, 149, 147, 135, 119, 105, 89, and 79, reflecting characteristic cleavage patterns of the benzofuran-derived structure. The peak at m/z 176 (191–15) suggests loss of a methyl group (CH3), likely from the acetyl substituent. The fragment at m/z 147 (191–44) corresponds to the loss of the acetyl group (COCH3), leaving the methoxy-substituted benzofuran core. Further fragmentation at m/z 135 (147–12) may involve decarbonylation (loss of CO) from the remaining acetyl-derived fragment. The peak at m/z 119 (135–16) could arise from loss of an oxygen atom or rearrangement within the benzofuran ring system. Additional peaks at m/z 105 and 89 reflect successive cleavage of the methoxy group (OCH3, 31 Da) and furan ring fragmentation. The ion at m/z 79, a common fragment for aromatic systems, likely represents a tropylium ion or a benzene-derived fragment. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 75 suggests minimal aliphatic chain fragmentation. These observations align with the structure of 2-acetyl-6-methoxybenzofuran, where the acetyl and methoxy groups contribute to the observed fragmentation pathways. The spectrum highlights the stability of the aromatic system and the susceptibility of functional groups to homolytic cleavage under electron impact."

The most prominent signals appear between 0–200 ppm, with notable clusters in the aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroatom-adjacent regions. In the aliphatic region (0–60 ppm), peaks near 20–30 ppm correspond to the methylene carbons of the piperidine ring (C2–C5 in the CN1CCCCC1 moiety), while the N-methyl group (C1) appears as a sharp singlet near 45 ppm. A distinct resonance at ~60 ppm is attributed to the oxygen-bearing methylene carbon (CH2O) linking the piperidine to the aromatic system. The aromatic region (100–160 ppm) shows multiple intense peaks, reflecting the substituted benzene and pyridine rings. The pyridine ring (c4ccccn4) contributes signals near 120–135 ppm for its sp² carbons, with the carbon adjacent to nitrogen appearing downfield (~150 ppm) due to deshielding. The chloro-substituted benzene ring (c3ccc(OCc4...)c(Cl)c3) exhibits peaks at ~115–130 ppm, with the carbon para to chlorine shifted downfield (~135 ppm) due to the electron-withdrawing effect of Cl.

A sharp peak near 160 ppm likely corresponds to the carbon adjacent to the ether oxygen in the OCc4pyridine moiety, while the carbonyl region (160–200 ppm) is absent, consistent with the absence of ketone or ester groups in the structure. The spectrum’s complexity reflects the molecule’s 27 unique carbons, though some overlap may occur due to symmetry or similar electronic environments. Overall, the chemical shifts align with the expected electronic effects of substituents (e.g., Cl, O, N) and hybridization, providing a detailed fingerprint of the molecule’s carbon framework."

Starting from the high-field region (right), a sharp peak at ~20 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (–CH3) attached to the furan ring. This shift is typical for aliphatic carbons adjacent to electronegative oxygen in the furan moiety. Moving to lower fields (left), a peak at ~60 ppm may arise from the quaternary carbon in the triazine ring, deshielded by adjacent nitrogen atoms. The prominent peak at ~80 ppm is assigned to the two equivalent trichloromethyl (–C(Cl)3) groups attached to the triazine ring; the strong deshielding effect of three chlorine atoms per carbon elevates their chemical shift. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks reflect the sp2-hybridized carbons of the furan, triazine, and vinyl (–CH=CH–) groups. The peak at ~110 ppm likely corresponds to the furan ring carbons, particularly the carbon adjacent to oxygen, which experiences moderate deshielding. A cluster of peaks between ~130–150 ppm includes the vinyl carbons (–CH=CH–) bridging the furan and triazine rings, as well as the triazine ring carbons themselves. These shifts are consistent with conjugated systems where electron-withdrawing nitrogen and chlorine substituents increase deshielding. The most downfield peak at ~180 ppm is attributed to a triazine ring carbon directly bonded to nitrogen atoms, reflecting significant electron withdrawal. The relative intensities of the peaks align with the molecular symmetry: the two trichloromethyl groups (two equivalent carbons) produce a taller peak at 80 ppm, while the single methyl group (20 ppm) and unique triazine carbons (180 ppm) exhibit lower intensities. This spectrum confirms the presence of distinct carbon environments in the molecule, including aliphatic, aromatic, and highly electronegative substituent-bearing carbons, consistent with the proposed structure."

The molecular ion itself (C14H17BrO+) would theoretically appear at *m/z* 280 and 282 (due to the natural isotopic abundance of bromine, with 79Br and 81Br in a ~1:1 ratio), but these peaks are either absent or suppressed in this spectrum, suggesting extensive fragmentation. A pair of peaks at *m/z* 79 and 81 confirms the presence of bromine, as these values match the atomic masses of its isotopes. Additional significant peaks include *m/z* 105, which may arise from a benzoyl cation (C6H5CO+), a common fragment in aromatic ketones, and *m/z* 173, likely formed by the loss of CO (28 Da) from the *m/z* 201 fragment.

The absence of a strong molecular ion peak and the dominance of the *m/z* 201 fragment are consistent with the instability of the parent ion under electron ionization, typical for brominated compounds where halogen loss is favored. This fragmentation pattern aligns with the structure of the molecule, where the bromine atom is adjacent to a carbonyl group, facilitating α-cleavage. Overall, the spectrum reflects the characteristic behavior of a brominated aromatic ketone, with diagnostic peaks supporting the assigned molecular formula and structural features."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C13H10O4 (SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)c(OC(=O)c2ccccc2)co1). The spectrum displays direct correlations between proton (1H) and carbon (13C) nuclei, revealing key structural features. Four distinct cross-peaks are observed. The most downfield peak at ~12 ppm (1H) and ~190 ppm (13C) corresponds to a highly deshielded vinylic proton and its attached carbon, likely part of the conjugated pyrone ring system adjacent to the carbonyl group. A peak at ~11 ppm (1H) and ~170 ppm (13C) reflects a proton on a carbon near the ester linkage (O-C(=O)-Ph), consistent with the deshielded environment of the pyrone ring’s C3 position. The cross-peak at ~10 ppm (1H) and ~130 ppm (13C) arises from an aromatic or vinylic proton in the benzene ring of the ester moiety, with the carbon shift indicating sp2 hybridization. Finally, a peak at ~4 ppm (1H) and ~50 ppm (13C) suggests a methyl group (CH3) attached to the pyrone ring (C2 position), where the moderate deshielding of the carbon may result from its proximity to the ring oxygen. These observations align with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of a methyl-substituted pyrone core esterified with a benzoyl group, as described by the SMILES notation. The spectrum effectively maps the molecule’s protonated carbons and their respective hydrogens, providing insights into its electronic and structural framework."

The spectrum displays a dominant base peak at m/z 453, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 452.46 g/mol for C27H28N6O. This peak confirms the intact molecular structure under the ionization conditions used. Several significant fragment ions are observed, providing insights into the molecule’s structural features. A peak at m/z 436 (453 – 17) suggests loss of ammonia (NH3), likely originating from the piperidine or pyrimidine nitrogen atoms. The fragment at m/z 368 (453 – 85) may arise from cleavage of the amide bond (C=O-N) in the piperidine ring, releasing a C5H7N fragment (85 Da) derived from the pyrrolidine-carboxamide moiety. Adjacent peaks at m/z 354 (453 – 99) and 367 (453 – 86) indicate additional fragmentation pathways, possibly involving the spirocyclic cyclopropane-pyrrolidine system (CC32CC2) or the pyridine-cyclopropyl substituent. The absence of prominent peaks below m/z 300 suggests that the molecule’s rigid polycyclic framework (including the spiro[cyclopropane-pyrrolidine] and aromatic systems) resists extensive fragmentation, favoring retention of larger structural motifs. The peak at m/z 367 may also reflect a stable carbocation formed via homolytic cleavage of the N-aryl bond in the pyrimidine ring (n2ncc...cn2), while the m/z 354 fragment could involve further loss of a small neutral species (e.g., C2H4, 28 Da) from the cyclopropyl group. Overall, the spectrum highlights the molecule’s robust aromatic and aliphatic components, with fragmentation patterns consistent with its complex heterocyclic architecture. The observed peaks corroborate the presence of key functional groups, including the amide, pyridine, pyrimidine, and cyclopropyl moieties, as defined by the SMILES notation."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C15H17NO2 (SMILES: Cc1ccc(C)n1-c1ccc(CCC(=O)O)cc1). The spectrum exhibits several key features characteristic of this compound. The most prominent peak occurs at m/z 244, representing the molecular ion (M⁺) corresponding to the intact molecule. This peak serves as the molecular weight reference, confirming the formula C15H17NO2 (calculated mass: 243.3 Da). A significant fragment ion at m/z 226 (relative abundance ~10%) likely arises from the loss of a hydroxyl group (H₂O, 18 Da) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for carboxylic acid-containing compounds. Additional notable peaks include m/z 198 (relative abundance ~8%), which may result from decarboxylation (loss of CO₂, 44 Da) from the molecular ion, and m/z 184 (relative abundance ~5%), potentially formed via further fragmentation of the decarboxylated species. The peak at m/z 96 (relative abundance ~20%) corresponds to a fragment containing the aromatic ring and adjacent methyl groups, consistent with cleavage of the C-N bond in the heterocyclic ring system. Minor peaks at m/z 170 and 172 (isotopic pattern) suggest the presence of chlorine or bromine isotopes, though this is inconsistent with the given formula and may indicate trace impurities or instrumental artifacts. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 100 indicates limited fragmentation of the aromatic and heterocyclic core structures. The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the carboxylic acid side chain, which facilitates dehydration and decarboxylation, and the stable aromatic/heteroaromatic system, which contributes to the persistence of larger fragments. This spectrum provides critical insights into the compound’s structural integrity and decomposition pathways under electron ionization conditions."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H14O2 (SMILES: CC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)CO). The spectrum displays seven distinct signals, corresponding to the unique carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak at ~200 ppm is characteristic of the carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the ketone functional group. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~50 ppm is assigned to the quaternary carbon bonded to the carbonyl group, methyl group, benzyl group, and hydroxymethyl group. This carbon’s chemical shift reflects deshielding due to its proximity to the electronegative carbonyl oxygen. The aromatic region shows two prominent peaks at ~150 ppm and ~120 ppm. The signal at ~150 ppm corresponds to the ipso carbon of the benzene ring, which is directly bonded to the benzyl CH2 group and experiences deshielding from the adjacent substituent. The cluster of peaks around ~120 ppm represents the remaining aromatic carbons in the monosubstituted benzene ring, typical of sp²-hybridized carbons in a phenyl group. In the aliphatic region, the peak at ~30 ppm is attributed to the benzyl CH2 group (CH2Ph), which is slightly deshielded due to its attachment to the aromatic ring. The methyl group (CH3) appears as a sharp signal at ~20 ppm, consistent with its electron-donating nature and lack of strong deshielding effects. Finally, the hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) is observed at ~100 ppm, an unusually downfield shift likely caused by the combined effects of the adjacent carbonyl group and hydrogen bonding involving the hydroxyl proton. This spectral pattern aligns with the molecular structure, where the ketone, aromatic ring, and hydroxymethyl functionalities create distinct electronic environments for each carbon atom. The absence of additional peaks confirms the molecule’s symmetry and the uniqueness of each carbon site."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H12ClNO2 (SMILES: O=C(O)C1(c2cccc(Cl)n2)CCCC1). The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule's structural features. The most prominent peak appears near 170–180 ppm, consistent with the carboxylic acid carbon (C=O), which typically resonates in this high-field region due to deshielding from the electronegative oxygen atoms. Adjacent to this, a cluster of peaks between 150–120 ppm corresponds to the aromatic carbons of the 2-chloropyridine ring. The substitution pattern (chlorine at the 2-position) creates distinct electronic environments for each aromatic carbon, resulting in multiple resonances. For example, the carbon adjacent to chlorine (C-3) is expected to appear downfield (higher ppm) due to the inductive effect of chlorine, while the nitrogen-bearing carbon (C-2) may resonate near 150 ppm. In the aliphatic region (0–60 ppm), several peaks are observed, including a notable resonance near 40–50 ppm, likely corresponding to the cyclopentane carbon directly bonded to the carboxylic acid and pyridine ring (C-1 of the cyclopentane). This carbon experiences deshielding from the adjacent electronegative groups. Additional peaks in the 20–30 ppm range reflect the remaining cyclopentane carbons, which are relatively shielded due to their saturated nature. The spectrum lacks signals above 200 ppm, confirming the absence of ketone or aldehyde carbons, and no peaks are observed near 0 ppm, ruling out significant aliphatic chain branching or methyl groups. The integration of these observations aligns with the proposed structure: a carboxylic acid-functionalized cyclopentane fused to a 2-chloropyridine ring. The number of distinct resonances (approximately 11–12 peaks) matches the molecule's symmetry, as the cyclopentane and pyridine rings each contribute unique carbon environments. This spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule's electronic structure and connectivity, validating its identity as O=C(O)C1(c2cccc(Cl)n2)CCCC1."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 207, corresponding to the intact molecule. The base peak at m/z 91, the most intense signal, is characteristic of the tropylium ion (C7H7+), a common fragment in aromatic compounds, likely arising from the benzyl group (–CH2C6H5) in the structure. A minor peak at m/z 92 suggests the presence of a [M+1] isotopic peak, consistent with natural carbon-13 abundance. Additional significant peaks include m/z 108, which may result from the loss of a benzyl radical (C7H7, 91 Da) from the molecular ion, yielding a fragment at 207 – 91 = 116 Da (though the observed peak at 108 suggests further fragmentation). The peak at m/z 133 could correspond to the loss of the ethyl ester group (C2H5O2, 61 Da) from the molecular ion (207 – 61 = 146), followed by additional cleavage. The peak at m/z 179 may arise from the loss of CO (28 Da) from the molecular ion (207 – 28 = 179), a common fragmentation pathway for esters. A minor peak at m/z 65, a smaller aromatic fragment, further supports the presence of a benzyl moiety. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the stability of the tropylium ion and the susceptibility of the ester and hydrazone linkages to cleavage under electron ionization. The molecular ion’s prominence confirms the compound’s molecular weight, while the relative abundances of fragments provide insights into its structural features."

The most prominent peak appears as a sharp singlet near 2.0 ppm, which corresponds to the six equivalent methyl protons (3H each) from the two ethyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom in the diazepine ring. Adjacent to this, a smaller singlet at ~4.0 ppm likely represents the four methylene protons (2H each) of the same ethyl groups, shifted slightly downfield due to their proximity to the electronegative nitrogen. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the complex environment of the molecule’s three aromatic systems: the fluorinated phenyl ring, the pyridine ring, and the diazepine core. The fluorophenyl group contributes a doublet near 7.2 ppm (J ≈ 8.5 Hz) and a triplet near 7.0 ppm (J ≈ 8.5 Hz), arising from the ortho- and meta-coupled protons relative to the fluorine substituent. The pyridine ring exhibits two distinct doublets at ~8.5 ppm and ~7.8 ppm (J ≈ 5.0 Hz), corresponding to the protons adjacent to the nitrogen and those in the para position, respectively. Additional multiplets in the 7.5–8.0 ppm range are attributed to the diazepine ring protons, which experience deshielding from the adjacent nitrogen atoms. A notable singlet at ~12.0 ppm is observed, which may correspond to a highly deshielded proton on the diazepine ring, potentially influenced by intramolecular hydrogen bonding or ring current effects. The absence of broad peaks suggests no exchangeable protons (e.g., NH or OH) are present. The integration of peaks aligns with the molecular formula, with aliphatic protons (10H) and aromatic protons (11H) accounting for the total hydrogen count. The spectrum’s splitting patterns and chemical shifts provide clear evidence of the molecule’s conjugated aromatic systems and the electronic influence of the fluorine substituent."

The adjacent peak at m/z 396 suggests a fragment formed via the loss of a nitro group (-NO2, 46 Da) or a carboxylic acid moiety (-COOH, 45 Da). The cluster of intense peaks between m/z 116–118 likely arises from fragmentation of the sulfonamide (NS(=O)(=O)) and nitroaromatic groups. The triplet pattern at m/z 116, 117, and 118 may reflect isotopic contributions from sulfur (³²S vs. ³⁴S) and nitrogen/oxygen isotopes, characteristic of fragments containing these elements. Peaks at m/z 136 and 147 could correspond to substituted benzyl or nitrophenyl fragments, while signals at m/z 194 and 195 may represent larger segments of the aromatic system retaining sulfonamide or nitro functionalities.

The spectrum’s high-resolution features and fragmentation pattern align with the structural complexity of the molecule, which contains multiple nitro groups, a sulfonamide linkage, and a carboxylic acid moiety. These functional groups contribute to the observed mass distribution through characteristic cleavage pathways, such as homolytic bond breaking or charge-driven rearrangements. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 441 confirms the molecular ion’s stability under the ionization conditions used.

The amide proton (NC(=O)) appears as a weak correlation near 9–10 ppm (¹H), paired with a carbonyl carbon at ~165 ppm (¹³C), characteristic of the amide functional group. A high-field peak at ~2.5 ppm (¹H) and ~30 ppm (¹³C) indicates the presence of a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a nitrogen atom (N-CH₃), consistent with the methyl substituent in the SMILES notation. The overall distribution of peaks reflects the molecule’s heteroaromatic and halogenated aromatic components, with HSQC correlations enabling direct assignment of protonated carbons. This spectrum provides critical insights into the molecular framework, confirming the connectivity of protons to their respective carbons in this complex heterocyclic system."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C15H19NO3 (SMILES: COc1ccc2c(c1)OC(=O)N(C1CCCCC1)C2). The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 262, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. The base peak (most intense signal) appears at m/z 137, indicating a highly stable fragment ion formed via cleavage of the parent structure. A significant peak at m/z 136, nearly equivalent in intensity to the base peak, suggests a fragment ion differing by one mass unit, likely due to a distinct fragmentation pathway. Additional notable peaks include m/z 77, 79, and 83, which are characteristic of aromatic ring fragments, consistent with the benzene ring in the methoxyphenyl moiety. The cluster of peaks between m/z 95–112 (95, 107, 112) may arise from fragmentation of the cyclohexyl group or combined loss of small neutral species such as CO or H2O. Peaks at m/z 122, 123, and 125 suggest further degradation of the heterocyclic oxazolidinone ring system, with possible contributions from isotopic variants (e.g., 13C-containing fragments). The peak at m/z 135, adjacent to the base peak, likely represents a minor structural isomer or a fragment with a retained functional group. Peaks at m/z 164 and 165, with moderate intensity, could correspond to fragments retaining portions of the methoxyphenyl and cyclohexyl groups. The peak at m/z 180, though less intense, may indicate a stable intermediate formed by cleavage of the O–C bond in the oxazolidinone ring. The molecular ion peak at m/z 262 confirms the molecular formula C15H19NO3, as calculated from the exact mass (261.1365 Da, observed as 262 due to protonation in the ionization source). The fragmentation pattern aligns with the proposed structure, where the oxazolidinone ring and cyclohexyl substituent contribute to the observed daughter ions. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 262 suggests minimal dimerization or adduct formation under the experimental conditions. Overall, the spectrum reflects the compound’s structural features through characteristic fragmentation pathways, including aromatic ring stability, heterocyclic ring cleavage, and aliphatic group losses, consistent with the assigned molecular formula and SMILES notation."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) experiment provides direct correlations between proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the structure. The spectrum displays distinct cross-peaks corresponding to the molecule's aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroatom-bound functional groups. In the aliphatic region, cross-peaks are observed for the tert-butyl group of the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) moiety, with ¹H signals near 1.4 ppm correlating to ¹³C resonances around 28 ppm. These peaks reflect the equivalent methyl carbons of the Boc group. Additional aliphatic signals appear at ~3.4–3.8 ppm (¹H) and ~40–60 ppm (¹³C), consistent with methylene groups adjacent to heteroatoms (e.g., the NCH₂CH₂O segment of the ethanolamine side chain). The aromatic region exhibits cross-peaks between 6.8–7.8 ppm (¹H) and 110–140 ppm (¹³C), corresponding to the chlorophenyl-substituted benzimidazole ring. The chlorine substituent induces deshielding effects, shifting the adjacent aromatic carbons and protons downfield. Notably, the imidazole ring's C2 position (directly bonded to the ethylene linker) likely contributes to a cross-peak near 7.0 ppm (¹H) and 120 ppm (¹³C), while the C5/C7 positions of the chlorophenyl group appear at higher ¹³C shifts (~130 ppm). A prominent cross-peak at ~8.2 ppm (¹H) and ~155 ppm (¹³C) suggests a protonated carbon in a deshielded environment, potentially the C2 position of the benzimidazole ring. The Boc carbonyl carbon (~155 ppm) may also contribute to this region, though its correlation to a proton is absent (as it is quaternary). The absence of signals beyond 160 ppm (¹³C) indicates no additional conjugated carbonyl or highly deshielded sp² carbons. The hydroxyl proton of the ethanolamine side chain (likely exchange-broadened) and the Boc NH proton (expected ~5–6 ppm) are not distinctly resolved in this spectrum, possibly due to rapid exchange or low intensity. Overall, the HSQC data aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the Boc-protected amine, benzimidazole core, chlorophenyl substituent, and polar side chains. The correlations provide critical insights into the connectivity and electronic environment of protonated carbons, aiding in the complete NMR assignment of this compound."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum correlates directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing insights into the molecular structure through one-bond ¹H-¹³C interactions. The spectrum displays distinct clusters of peaks across the ¹H (x-axis, 0–14 ppm) and ¹³C (y-axis, 0–200 ppm) chemical shift ranges, reflecting the molecule’s diverse functional groups and aromatic/aliphatic environments. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic region (¹H: 7–8 ppm; ¹³C: 120–140 ppm):** A dense cluster of peaks in this region corresponds to the naphthalene (c1ccc2ccccc2c1) and phenyl (c1ccccc1) rings. The overlapping signals reflect the multiple aromatic protons and their directly bonded carbons, typical of conjugated systems with deshielded nuclei. 2. **Aliphatic region (¹H: 1–3 ppm; ¹³C: 20–50 ppm):** Peaks here are attributed to the tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) of the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group and the methine proton (CH) adjacent to the phenyl ring. The tert-butyl carbons appear as a singlet in ¹³C (~28 ppm) with corresponding ¹H signals (~1.4 ppm), while the methine carbon (~50–60 ppm) correlates with a proton at ~4.5 ppm, though this may overlap with other signals. 3. **Amide and carbonyl vicinity (¹H: 6–9 ppm; ¹³C: 150–180 ppm):** While carbonyl carbons (e.g., amide C=O) are not directly observed in HSQC due to the lack of directly bonded protons, the protons on carbons adjacent to carbonyls (e.g., the α-carbon of the amide) may appear in the 4–5 ppm range. The observed peaks in the 6–9 ppm region likely arise from amide NH protons or aromatic protons near electron-withdrawing groups. The spectrum’s distribution aligns with the molecule’s structural complexity, including aromatic systems, aliphatic substituents, and amide linkages. The absence of peaks in the ¹³C region above 180 ppm confirms no carboxylic acid or ketone carbonyls are present, consistent with the Boc-protected amide structure.

The ¹H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans from 14 to -2 ppm, while the ¹³C axis (y-axis) ranges from 0 to 200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm, 120–140 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks are observed in this region, corresponding to protons and carbons in the aromatic systems. The molecule contains two aromatic rings: a benzene ring substituted with a tert-butyl group and an ether-linked pyridine ring bearing an isocyanate (-N=C=O) group. The pyridine ring protons (e.g., H-3, H-4, H-5) and benzene ring protons (ortho/para to the tert-butyl group) exhibit chemical shifts typical of electron-deficient and electron-rich aromatic environments, respectively. The ¹³C shifts in the 120–140 ppm range align with sp²-hybridized carbons in these rings. 2. **Aliphatic Region (1–2 ppm, 30–35 ppm):** A distinct cross-peak near 1.3 ppm (¹H) and 31 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the tert-butyl group. The high-field proton shift reflects the shielding effect of the aliphatic environment, while the carbon shift is consistent with a quaternary carbon bonded to three methyl groups. 3. **Deshielded Proton (12 ppm, 160 ppm):** A prominent cross-peak at ~12 ppm (¹H) and ~160 ppm (¹³C) suggests a highly deshielded proton-carbon pair. This is likely attributed to a proton on the pyridine ring adjacent to the electronegative oxygen atom (e.g., H-3 of the pyridine), which experiences strong deshielding due to the inductive effect of the ether linkage and the electron-withdrawing isocyanate group. The ¹³C shift at 160 ppm is characteristic of a carbon atom bonded to an oxygen atom (C-O) in an aromatic system. 4. **Absence of Carbonyl Correlation:** The isocyanate carbon (N=C=O) is expected near 120–130 ppm in the ¹³C dimension but does not appear in the HSQC spectrum, as it lacks a directly attached proton. This spectrum effectively maps the protonated carbons of the molecule, confirming the presence of aromatic systems, an aliphatic tert-butyl group, and a deshielded pyridine proton influenced by adjacent heteroatoms. The data align with the proposed structure, validating the connectivity of the benzene, pyridine, and functional groups."

A broad, moderate-intensity band near 3300 cm⁻¹ is indicative of N–H stretching vibrations, consistent with the secondary amine group (–NH–) in the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety. Sharp, intense peaks around 2900–2850 cm⁻¹ correspond to aliphatic C–H stretching vibrations from the saturated carbon framework, including the piperidine ring and alkyl chains. A prominent carbonyl (C=O) stretching absorption is observed near 1700 cm⁻¹, which aligns with the ketone group (O=C–) adjacent to the aromatic ring. A slightly less intense peak near 1650 cm⁻¹ may arise from the amide carbonyl (C=O) within the succinamide-derived fragment (–CCC(=O)N–), though its exact position could be influenced by conjugation or hydrogen bonding. Additional peaks near 1600 and 1500 cm⁻¹ are attributed to aromatic C=C stretching vibrations, reflecting the substituted benzene rings in the structure. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex absorptions, including a distinct band near 1450 cm⁻¹ (C–H bending of CH2 groups) and a sharp peak at ~1250 cm⁻¹, likely corresponding to C–N stretching vibrations from the amine and amide functionalities. A peak near 1000 cm⁻¹ may indicate C–Cl stretching, consistent with the chloro-substituted aromatic ring. Weaker absorptions in the 800–600 cm⁻¹ range further support the presence of aromatic substitution patterns and skeletal deformations.

The peak at **170 ppm** corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the amide group, a characteristic downfield shift due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The resonance at **155 ppm** is likely the imine carbon (C=N) of the oxime ether moiety, influenced by the electronegative oxygen substituent. The cluster of peaks between **130–140 ppm** arises from aromatic carbons in the two benzene rings, with variations in chemical shift reflecting substitution patterns and electronic effects from the ethyl linker (–CH2CH2–) and oxime group. In the aliphatic region, the peak near **60 ppm** corresponds to the methoxy group (–OCH3) attached to the oxime nitrogen, while the signal at **30 ppm** is attributed to the methylene carbons (–CH2–) in the ethyl bridge connecting the aromatic rings. The methyl group attached to the amide nitrogen (–NCH3) appears as a weaker resonance near **40 ppm**, slightly upfield due to its proximity to the less electronegative nitrogen. The spectrum exhibits a total of 12 distinct carbon environments, consistent with the molecular symmetry of the two identical benzene rings and the non-equivalent carbons in the central chain.

The most downfield peak at ~14 ppm corresponds to the NH proton of the quinolinone ring, which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent carbonyl group (C=O) and trifluoromethyl (CF3) substituent. A prominent peak at ~12 ppm is attributed to the proton at position 3 of the heterocyclic ring, directly adjacent to both the carbonyl and CF3 groups, which significantly deshield this hydrogen. Three additional peaks in the 11–8.5 ppm range represent the aromatic protons on the benzene ring. The peak at ~11 ppm arises from a proton meta to the iodine substituent, while the signals at ~10 ppm and ~8.5 ppm correspond to protons ortho and para to the iodine, respectively. The iodine atom exerts a strong deshielding effect through inductive withdrawal, shifting these protons downfield compared to typical aromatic regions. The absence of peaks above 0.03 intensity in other regions confirms the lack of aliphatic or non-aromatic protons, aligning with the molecular formula. The integration of all peaks (assuming equal intensity per proton) matches the five hydrogen atoms in the molecule: one NH proton, one heterocyclic proton, and three aromatic protons.

In the aromatic region, peaks appear at ~7.5–8.5 ppm (¹H) and ~125–150 ppm (¹³C), consistent with protons and carbons in the phenyl (c2ccccc2) and pyrimidine (c1cnc(-c2ccccc2)nc1) rings. These shifts reflect deshielding effects from aromatic conjugation and electronegative nitrogen atoms in the pyrimidine ring. Additional peaks at ~4.5–5.0 ppm (¹H) and ~50–60 ppm (¹³C) correspond to methylene (CH₂) groups in the piperazine ring (N1CCN(CCO)CC1) and the ethanolamine side chain (CCO), where proximity to nitrogen and oxygen atoms induces downfield shifts. A distinct peak at ~10.5 ppm (¹H) and ~150 ppm (¹³C) likely arises from a pyrimidine ring proton adjacent to two nitrogen atoms, experiencing strong deshielding. The absence of correlations in the carbonyl region (160–220 ppm) aligns with the amide carbonyl (O=C(NN1...)) lacking directly attached protons. Overall, the spectrum confirms the connectivity of aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic moieties in the molecule, with chemical shifts consistent with the provided structure."

    "text": "This is a H-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C15H19N3O2 (SMILES: Cc1ccc(OCCCC(N)=O)c(Cc2ncc[nH]2)c1). The spectrum displays characteristic peaks corresponding to the protons in the aromatic ring, aliphatic chain, and functional groups of the molecule. The most prominent peak appears at approximately 10.2 ppm, which is consistent with the amide NH2 group in the OCCCC(=O)NH2 side chain. This singlet arises from the two equivalent protons of the amide, which experience strong deshielding due to the adjacent carbonyl group. In the aromatic region (6.8–7.5 ppm), multiple peaks are observed. The doublet at ~7.2 ppm and the multiplet at ~6.8 ppm correspond to the protons on the substituted benzene ring. The splitting pattern reflects the coupling between aromatic protons, with the deshielded doublet likely adjacent to the electron-withdrawing OCCCC(=O)NH2 group, while the upfield multiplet is influenced by the electron-donating methyl (CH3) and imidazole-containing substituents. A singlet at ~2.3 ppm integrates to three protons, assignable to the methyl group (CH3) attached to the aromatic ring. This signal is slightly deshielded due to its proximity to the aromatic system. The methylene protons (CH2) in the OCCCC(=O)NH2 chain appear as a triplet at ~3.4 ppm (adjacent to oxygen) and a triplet at ~2.3 ppm (adjacent to the carbonyl group). These peaks reflect the distinct electronic environments of the CH2 groups in the aliphatic chain. Additionally, a broad singlet at ~6.8 ppm is attributed to the imidazole NH proton in the Cc2ncc[nH]2 group, which participates in hydrogen bonding and exhibits variable chemical shifts. The remaining methylene protons in the aliphatic chain (CH2CH2) appear as a multiplet at ~1.8 ppm, consistent with their shielding in a less electronegative environment. The spectrum confirms the presence of all proton environments in the molecule, with chemical shifts and splitting patterns aligning with the proposed structure. The integration of peaks further supports the molecular formula, as the relative intensities correspond to the expected number of protons in each distinct chemical environment."

The spectrum displays multiple distinct peaks in the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), consistent with the molecule's fully aromatic structure comprising fused heterocyclic rings and chlorinated phenyl groups. The most prominent signals appear between 120–140 ppm, reflecting carbons in electron-deficient environments influenced by electronegative substituents (Cl, N). The intense peak near 125 ppm likely corresponds to the imidazole ring carbons (C2/C5), which are deshielded by adjacent nitrogen atoms. Peaks at ~130–135 ppm may arise from pyridine ring carbons (C3/C5 in the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine system), while signals near 140 ppm are attributed to quaternary carbons bonded to chlorine (C4 in chlorophenyl groups). The absence of signals below 100 ppm confirms no sp³-hybridized carbons, and the lack of peaks above 160 ppm excludes carbonyl or highly conjugated carbons. The multiplicity of peaks reflects the molecule's structural complexity, with distinct chemical environments for each aromatic carbon due to steric and electronic effects from the three chlorine atoms and two nitrogen-containing heterocycles. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the molecule's conjugated π-system and the influence of halogen and heteroatom substituents on carbon shielding."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides a correlation between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the molecular structure. The spectrum displays two distinct regions of interest. In the aromatic region, a cluster of cross-peaks is observed between 10–12 ppm in the ¹H dimension and 100–150 ppm in the ¹³C dimension, consistent with the presence of multiple aromatic protons and their directly attached carbons. These signals likely originate from the benzene rings in the structure, including the substituted phenyl groups (e.g., the iodophenyl and fluorophenyl moieties) and the pyridine ring. The deshielding effects of electronegative substituents (F, I, and O) likely contribute to the downfield shifts of these resonances. A single cross-peak at approximately 2 ppm (¹H) and 50 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the tert-butyl group (CC(C)(C)O), where the protonated carbons of the methyl groups are shielded due to their aliphatic nature and lack of conjugation. The absence of additional cross-peaks in the aliphatic region (e.g., 0–5 ppm in ¹H and 0–60 ppm in ¹³C) confirms that no other protonated aliphatic carbons are present. The amide carbonyl (C(N)=O) and ester carbonyl (OC(=O)N) groups do not appear in the HSQC spectrum, as they lack directly bonded protons. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the expected protonated carbon framework of the molecule, with aromatic and aliphatic regions reflecting the structural motifs in the SMILES notation."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, enabling the identification of protonated carbon environments. The spectrum displays key features consistent with the molecular structure, including aromatic, amide, carboxylic acid, and aliphatic regions. In the aromatic region (¹H: 7.0–8.0 ppm; ¹³C: 120–140 ppm), multiple cross-peaks are observed, corresponding to the benzene ring substituent (c1ccccc1) in the SMILES notation. These peaks reflect the coupling between aromatic protons and their directly bonded carbons, with chemical shifts typical for unsubstituted or lightly substituted benzene rings. The presence of multiple distinct peaks suggests non-equivalent aromatic protons, likely due to the adjacent amide linkage and steric effects. The amide functional groups are evident in the ¹H range of 6.5–8.5 ppm and ¹³C range of 160–180 ppm. The cross-peaks in this region correspond to the NH protons and carbonyl carbons of the amide bonds (NC(=O) and NC1C(=O)N2). The downfield ¹³C shifts (160–180 ppm) confirm the presence of sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons, while the ¹H shifts (7–8 ppm) are consistent with deshielding effects from adjacent electronegative atoms. A prominent cross-peak near ¹H 6.0 ppm and ¹³C 130 ppm likely arises from the vinylic proton and carbon in the C=C double bond (C=CC(=O)O), which is part of the thiazolidine ring system. This region is characteristic of olefinic protons and their coupled carbons, with the ¹³C shift slightly upfield due to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group. The aliphatic region (¹H: 2.0–4.0 ppm; ¹³C: 30–60 ppm) shows correlations for the thiazolidine ring’s CH₂ groups and the methine carbon adjacent to the sulfur atom (CS[C@H]12). The ¹H shifts around 3.0–4.0 ppm are consistent with protons on carbons bonded to sulfur or nitrogen, while the ¹³C shifts (40–60 ppm) align with sp³-hybridized carbons in a heterocyclic framework. Finally, the carboxylic acid groups (C(=O)O) are indicated by broad ¹H resonances near 10–12 ppm (not fully visible in this spectrum) and ¹³C shifts at ~170 ppm. The absence of strong peaks in the extreme downfield ¹H region suggests partial suppression of exchangeable protons or limited sensitivity in this spectral window. Overall, the HSQC spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the aromatic, amide, olefinic, and heterocyclic components of the molecule. The correlations provide critical insights into the connectivity and electronic environment of protonated carbons, supporting the assigned molecular framework."

The spectrum exhibits several prominent peaks that reflect characteristic fragmentation patterns of the Boc-protected hydrazine derivative. The base peak at m/z 100 (100% relative abundance) suggests a highly stable fragment, likely arising from the loss of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group (C4H9O2, 89 Da) from the molecular ion, followed by rearrangement or further fragmentation. The peak at m/z 57 (57% abundance) corresponds to the tert-butyl cation (C4H9+), a common fragment for Boc-protected compounds due to cleavage of the C-O bond in the Boc moiety. Additional significant peaks include m/z 99 (99% abundance), which may represent a fragment retaining part of the hydrazine backbone (e.g., C4H9N2O+), and m/z 116 (116% abundance), potentially indicative of a Boc-related fragment combined with a portion of the alkyl chain. The peak at m/z 175 (175% abundance) likely corresponds to the molecular ion minus the propyl group (C3H7, 43 Da), yielding a fragment with the formula C9H19N2O2+ (calculated m/z 175.14). Smaller peaks at m/z 69, 145, and 157 may arise from further cleavage of the alkyl chain or hydrazine moiety, such as loss of CH2 or NH units. The absence of a detectable molecular ion peak (expected at m/z 230) suggests instability of the parent ion under electron ionization conditions, a common feature for Boc-protected amines. The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the proposed structure, where the Boc group (tert-butyl ester) dominates the spectral features through predictable cleavage pathways. These data confirm the molecular identity and provide insight into the compound’s structural stability under mass spectrometric analysis."

The most downfield peak, near 200 ppm, is characteristic of the ketone carbonyl carbon in the cyclohexanone ring, reflecting strong deshielding due to the adjacent oxygen. A prominent peak at ~170 ppm corresponds to the ester carbonyl carbon, which is slightly less deshielded than the ketone due to resonance stabilization with the adjacent oxygen. The peak at ~80 ppm arises from the quaternary carbon of the tert-butyl group, which is bonded to the ester oxygen and experiences moderate deshielding. The amine-bearing carbon (α-carbon to the NH₂ group) appears at ~50 ppm, consistent with its attachment to an electronegative nitrogen. Peaks in the 20–40 ppm range represent the aliphatic carbons of the cyclohexanone ring and the tert-butyl methyl groups. The tert-butyl methyl carbons (three equivalent groups) typically resonate near 27 ppm, contributing to a moderately intense peak due to their threefold symmetry. The remaining ring carbons exhibit shifts between 20–40 ppm, reflecting their varying distances from the ketone and the amine-substituted carbon. The absence of peaks below 0 ppm confirms no sp² hybridized carbons outside the carbonyl groups, aligning with the saturated nature of the cyclohexanone and tert-butyl moieties.

A broad, intense band centered near 3400 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of hydroxyl (O-H) stretching vibrations, likely from the multiple hydroxyl groups in the sugar-like ring structure and the primary alcohol group. This region also overlaps with potential N-H stretching vibrations from the secondary amine (CCCC-NH-CH₂-), though the dominance of O-H features suggests the amine contribution is minor. Sharp peaks near 2920 cm⁻¹ and 2850 cm⁻¹ correspond to symmetric and asymmetric C-H stretching vibrations in the aliphatic butyl chain (CCCC-). A prominent absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ is absent, confirming the lack of carbonyl (C=O) groups, while a moderate band near 1640 cm⁻¹ may arise from N-H bending vibrations or C-OH deformation modes. The fingerprint region (1500–500 cm⁻¹) displays complex, overlapping peaks, including intense bands near 1050 cm⁻¹ and 1150 cm⁻¹, which are consistent with C-O stretching in ethers and hydroxyl-bearing carbons within the pyranose-like ring.

The most prominent peak appears near 13 ppm as a sharp singlet, which is consistent with a deshielded NH proton, likely from the pyrazole ring (nH in the SMILES notation). This high chemical shift reflects strong hydrogen bonding or deshielding effects from the adjacent electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl (CF3) group and aromatic system. A second NH signal is observed near 12 ppm, likely corresponding to the secondary amine (N-H) linking the pyrazole to the quinazoline core. This peak is also a singlet, indicating no direct coupling to neighboring protons. In the aromatic region (8–10 ppm), multiple peaks are visible. The cluster between 9–10 ppm includes overlapping multiplets, which arise from protons on the CF3-substituted benzene ring and the quinazoline’s fused benzene moiety. The electron-withdrawing CF3 group deshields adjacent protons, shifting their signals downfield, while the quinazoline’s conjugated system further influences chemical shifts. The peak near 8 ppm may correspond to a proton on the quinazoline ring or a meta/para position of the CF3-substituted benzene. No aliphatic protons are observed, aligning with the molecular formula’s absence of sp3-hybridized carbons. The spectrum’s simplicity in the 0–7 ppm range confirms the lack of non-aromatic hydrogens. The integration of peaks (not explicitly shown) would reflect 13 total protons: two from NH groups and eleven aromatic protons distributed across the three aromatic rings (CF3-phenyl, quinazoline, and pyrazole).

Additional peaks in the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) include C–S stretching vibrations from the thiazole sulfur atom, typically observed near 700–800 cm⁻¹, though overlapping with other ring deformation modes. The absence of a carbonyl (C=O) stretch near 1700 cm⁻¹ aligns with the molecular formula and SMILES notation, which lack ketone or ester functionalities. The spectrum’s complexity in the 1300–1500 cm⁻¹ range reflects coupled vibrations of the thiazole ring and morpholine ring deformations. These features collectively confirm the presence of the hydroxyl, thiazole, and morpholine moieties in the molecule."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon environments across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (120–160 ppm):** - A prominent peak near **130 ppm** corresponds to aromatic carbons in the benzene rings, particularly those adjacent to electronegative substituents (e.g., the chlorine-substituted carbon in the 6-chloro-3,4-dihydroquinoline moiety). - Peaks between **120–130 ppm** arise from unsubstituted aromatic carbons in both the benzene and thiazole rings. The thiazole ring (N-cyclohexyl-thiazole) contributes to this region due to its electron-deficient aromatic system. 2. **Carbonyl Carbon (160–180 ppm):** - A distinct peak near **170 ppm** is attributed to the amide carbonyl carbon (C=O) in the O=[C]Nc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)Nc2nccs2)cc1 group. This high-field shift reflects the deshielding effect of the adjacent nitrogen and oxygen atoms. 3. **Aliphatic Region (20–60 ppm):** - A peak near **60 ppm** corresponds to the methylene carbon (CH2) in the CCO group, deshielded by the adjacent oxygen atom. - Peaks between **40–50 ppm** are assigned to the CH2 groups in the piperidine ring (N1CCCc2...), influenced by the nitrogen’s electron-withdrawing effect. - Additional aliphatic CH2 groups in the 3,4-dihydroquinoline and ethyl linker appear between **20–40 ppm**, with chemical shifts modulated by their proximity to the nitrogen and chlorine substituents. 4. **Sulfur- and Chlorine-Substituted Carbons:** - The carbon bonded to chlorine in the benzene ring (cc(Cl)ccc21) likely contributes to a slightly downfield shift (closer to 140 ppm) compared to other aromatic carbons. - The sulfonamide group (S(=O)2) does not directly appear in the C-NMR spectrum, as sulfur-bound carbons are absent in this moiety. The spectrum’s peak distribution reflects the molecule’s structural complexity, with clear differentiation between aromatic, carbonyl, and aliphatic environments. The absence of overlapping peaks in critical regions (e.g., the resolved amide carbonyl) suggests minimal conformational flexibility in the solid-state or solution-state structure. This C-NMR data aligns with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of distinct functional groups and their electronic influences on carbon shielding."

The spectrum displays four distinct cross-peaks, indicating direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei. The most downfield ¹H chemical shift (~10.5 ppm) corresponds to the amide proton (NH) of the succinimide ring, which is coupled to a ¹³C signal at ~168 ppm, consistent with the adjacent carbonyl carbon. Three aromatic proton signals appear in the 7.4–7.6 ppm range, each correlating with ¹³C shifts at ~130 ppm, 128 ppm, and 126 ppm, reflecting the three distinct aromatic carbon environments in the dichlorophenyl ring. The upfield ¹H signal at ~4.2 ppm is assigned to the methylene group (CH₂) linking the succinimide and phenyl moieties, with its corresponding ¹³C shift at ~45 ppm. The absence of additional peaks confirms the lack of other protonated carbons, such as those in the non-protonated carbonyl positions of the succinimide ring or the chlorine-substituted aromatic carbons. This pattern aligns with the molecular structure, where the HSQC correlations provide direct evidence of the connectivity between the NH group, methylene bridge, and aromatic ring, while the chlorine substituents influence the electronic environment of the aromatic carbons, leading to their distinct chemical shifts."

Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 70, 71, 83, 84, 97, 98, 99, 108, 109, and 157. The molecular ion peak appears at m/z 157, which corresponds to the molecular weight of C8H12O3 (156 g/mol) plus one additional mass unit, likely representing an isotopic contribution (e.g., 13C or protonated species). The base peak at m/z 85 suggests a fragment ion containing a tert-butyl group (C4H9+) combined with a carbonyl moiety (CO), forming a stable oxonium ion (C5H9O+). This fragmentation likely arises from cleavage of the ether bond between the tert-butyl group and the propargyl-ester moiety, followed by rearrangement. The peaks at m/z 70 and 71 correspond to smaller hydrocarbon fragments, possibly C4H6O+ and C4H7O+, generated via further decomposition of the ester or propargyl group. Peaks at m/z 83 and 84 may represent homologous fragments with varying degrees of hydrogenation (e.g., C5H7O+ and C5H8O+), while m/z 97, 98, and 99 suggest retention of the ester functionality (C6H9O2+ or related structures). The peak at m/z 108 and 109 likely corresponds to fragments retaining part of the aromatic or conjugated system, such as C7H8O+ or C7H9O+. The absence of a strong molecular ion peak at m/z 156 implies significant fragmentation under the ionization conditions, consistent with the presence of labile functional groups like esters and ethers. The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of C#CC(C)(C)OCC(=O)OC, including the tert-butyl group, propargyl linkage, and methyl ester. These fragments provide insights into the molecule’s connectivity and stability under mass spectrometric analysis."

The spectrum displays correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing key structural features. Two distinct regions of cross-peaks are observed. The first cluster, located between 12–10 ppm (¹H) and 150–100 ppm (¹³C), corresponds to aromatic protons and their directly bonded carbons. This aligns with the benzene and pyridine rings in the quinoline core (c2ccccc2 and nc1... in the SMILES), where deshielding effects from the electronegative nitrogen and methoxy group (OCH₃) shift signals downfield. The second prominent peak at ~6 ppm (¹H) and ~50 ppm (¹³C) reflects the methoxy group’s methyl protons and its attached carbon. The ¹³C shift of ~50 ppm is characteristic of a carbon bonded to oxygen (OCH₃), while the ¹H shift at 6 ppm suggests partial deshielding, possibly due to proximity to the aromatic system. Notably, no peaks are observed in the carboxylic acid region (¹³C ~170 ppm, ¹H ~10–12 ppm), consistent with the COOH group’s proton being exchangeable and its carbon lacking a directly bonded proton. The absence of aliphatic signals confirms the molecule’s predominantly aromatic structure.

The spectrum displays multiple prominent peaks across the m/z range, with the molecular ion peak observed at m/z 459, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+. The base peak (most intense signal) appears at m/z 403, indicating a major fragmentation pathway involving the loss of a 56 Da fragment, likely attributed to the cleavage of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group (C4H8O2, 88 Da) with concomitant loss of CO2 (44 Da), yielding a net loss of 56 Da. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 342, 359, 233, 143, and 91. The peak at m/z 359 (459 – 100 Da) suggests the loss of the Boc group (C5H9NO2, 101 Da), consistent with the SMILES notation’s NC(=O)OC(C)(C)C moiety. The peak at m/z 342 (359 – 17 Da) may arise from subsequent loss of ammonia (NH3) or a related small neutral fragment. The fragment at m/z 233 likely corresponds to a benzyl-containing moiety (C14H17NS, 233 Da), derived from cleavage of the sulfonamide (CCS(=O)(=O)NC) and retention of the benzyl-substituted cyclohexene ring. The peak at m/z 143 (C9H11N, 133 Da + 10 Da adjustment) may represent a smaller aromatic fragment, while m/z 91 is characteristic of the benzyl cation (C7H7+), a common fragment in aromatic systems. The spectrum also exhibits several mid-intensity peaks between m/z 200–300, including 205, 248, 276, and 294, which may arise from further fragmentation of the sulfonamide or hydrocarbon backbone. The presence of sulfur is inferred from the molecular formula, though no distinct isotope pattern (e.g., 34S) is resolved in the spectrum. The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the sulfonamide, Boc-protected amine, and benzyl substituents, providing insights into its thermal stability and bond cleavage tendencies under ionization conditions. This analysis underscores the utility of mass spectrometry in elucidating structural motifs through characteristic fragment ions."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to the carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak at approximately 170 ppm is characteristic of the ester carbonyl carbon (C=O), which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the adjacent oxygen atoms. A prominent peak near 65 ppm arises from the carbon adjacent to the hydroxyl group in the 2-hydroxypropanoate moiety (CH(OH)), as well as the methylene carbon (O-CH2-) of the dodecyl chain directly bonded to the ester oxygen. These environments experience moderate deshielding from the electronegative oxygen atoms. The cluster of peaks between 20–30 ppm corresponds to the aliphatic carbons of the dodecyl chain. The methylene groups (CH2) in the long hydrocarbon tail resonate around 30 ppm, while the terminal methyl group (CH3) of the chain appears near 14 ppm, though it may overlap with baseline noise or other minor signals. The methyl group (CH3) attached to the hydroxyl-bearing carbon in the 2-hydroxypropanoate unit is observed at ~20 ppm, reflecting its proximity to the oxygenated carbon. Notably, the spectrum lacks additional peaks in the aromatic (100–160 ppm) or highly deshielded regions (>200 ppm), confirming the absence of aromatic rings or ketones. The simplicity of the spectrum, with fewer peaks than the total carbon count (15), reflects symmetry in the dodecyl chain and overlapping chemical shifts of equivalent carbons. This pattern aligns with the structure of dodecyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, where the ester linkage and hydroxyl group create distinct but predictable carbon environments."

A sharp peak around 50 ppm is assignable to the methylene carbons (CH2) of the piperidine ring adjacent to the sulfur atom, as sulfur deshields nearby carbons. The aromatic region (100–160 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks, including a cluster near 125–130 ppm and a distinct signal at ~150 ppm. These correspond to the substituted naphthalene ring system (Sc2ccc3cc(Cl)ccc3c2), with the chlorine substituent inducing downfield shifts in adjacent aromatic carbons.

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C10H7NO3 (SMILES: O=C(O)c1c(O)cnc2ccccc12). The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 189, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound. The base peak at m/z 172 indicates a dominant fragmentation pathway involving the loss of 17 Da, likely attributable to the elimination of a hydroxyl radical (•OH) from the carboxylic acid group, forming a stable conjugated quinoline-derived cation. Additional significant peaks at m/z 146 and 144 suggest further fragmentation via decarboxylation (loss of CO2, 44 Da) and concurrent loss of hydroxyl groups, consistent with the molecule’s functional groups. The peak at m/z 128 may arise from cleavage of the quinoline ring, yielding a fragment retaining the nitrogen heterocycle. Smaller peaks at m/z 92, 105, and 117 correspond to smaller aromatic or heterocyclic substructures, such as benzene or pyridine derivatives, formed through retro-Diels-Alder or other ring-opening mechanisms. The presence of peaks at m/z 173 and 190 may indicate isotopic contributions (e.g., 13C or 15N) or adduct formation, though the latter could also reflect minor dimerization or oxidation artifacts. The overall fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of a hydroxyquinoline carboxylic acid, where the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups facilitate multiple pathways for bond cleavage and stabilization of charged intermediates. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the molecular framework and characteristic decomposition pathways of the compound under electron ionization conditions."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks corresponding to direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei in the molecule. The ¹H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans ~14 to -2 ppm, while the ¹³C axis (y-axis) ranges from ~0 to 200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–9 ppm, 100–150 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks are observed in this region, consistent with the aromatic protons and carbons of the thiazole ring (sn1) and substituted benzene ring. The thiazole methyl group (Cc) likely contributes a peak near ~2.5 ppm (¹H) and ~15 ppm (¹³C), while the benzene ring protons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing nitrile (C#N) and fluorine (F) substituents appear deshielded (higher ¹H shifts, ~7.5–8.5 ppm) with corresponding ¹³C shifts ~120–140 ppm. 2. **Aliphatic Region (0–4 ppm, 10–60 ppm):** Peaks in this area correspond to the cyclopropyl group (CC3CC3) and the amide-bearing CH (C(N)=O). The cyclopropyl protons typically resonate at lower ¹H shifts (~0.5–1.5 ppm) with ¹³C shifts ~10–30 ppm, while the CH adjacent to the amide carbonyl may appear at ~3–4 ppm (¹H) and ~50–60 ppm (¹³C). 3. **Nitrile and Fluorine Effects:** The nitrile group (C#N) induces deshielding in nearby aromatic protons, evident as downfield ¹H shifts (~8 ppm). The fluorine substituent (F) causes further splitting and shifts in adjacent protons due to its electronegativity and spin-spin coupling, though HSQC does not directly detect ¹⁹F–¹H correlations. 4. **Amide Proton Visibility:** The amide NH protons (C(N)=O) are typically broad and exchangeable, often absent in HSQC spectra. Their absence here is consistent with this behavior. This HSQC spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule’s proton-carbon connectivity, confirming the presence of aromatic, aliphatic, and functionalized regions as described by the given SMILES structure."

The spectrum exhibits several key features consistent with the molecular structure. A broad, intense absorption near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the N-H stretching vibration of the indole moiety, while sharp peaks around 3050 cm⁻¹ indicate aromatic C-H stretching from the fluorophenyl and heterocyclic rings. The prominent carbonyl stretching band at ~1700 cm⁻¹ reflects the ketone (C=O) group attached to the fluorophenyl ring, with a slightly lower frequency suggesting conjugation with the aromatic system. A secondary carbonyl feature near 1650 cm⁻¹ aligns with the amide-like C=O in the pyridone ring. Multiple sharp peaks between 1600–1450 cm⁻¹ arise from C=C stretching in the aromatic and heteroaromatic systems, with additional contributions from C-N vibrations in the fused ring structure. The distinct absorption at ~1250 cm⁻¹ corresponds to C-F stretching of the para-fluorophenyl substituent, confirming the presence of the halogen. Complex fingerprint region peaks below 1200 cm⁻¹ reflect skeletal deformations, including C-C bending and ring vibrations. The absence of broad O-H signals rules out carboxylic acid or hydroxyl groups, consistent with the molecular formula. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting key functional groups and their electronic environments."

The spectrum displays distinct chemical shifts characteristic of aromatic and heterocyclic carbons, as well as functional group-specific resonances. The most prominent peak appears near 165 ppm, corresponding to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the methyl ester group, which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the oxygen atom. Adjacent to this, a peak around 150 ppm likely arises from the carbon directly bonded to the trifluoromethoxy group (-OCF3), as the electronegative fluorine atoms induce significant downfield shifts. Multiple peaks in the aromatic region (110–140 ppm) reflect the complex substitution pattern of the benzene rings and the thiazole heterocycle. The thiazole ring contributes resonances near 130–140 ppm, consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons in a five-membered ring containing nitrogen and sulfur. Additional aromatic carbons from the phenyl rings appear as a series of smaller peaks between 120–130 ppm, with their exact positions influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of the OCF3 group and the thiazole substituent. A distinct peak near 55 ppm is attributed to the methoxy group (-OCH3) of the ester, which typically appears in this region due to its sp³-hybridized carbon. The absence of signals below 50 ppm suggests no aliphatic or alkyl carbons are present beyond the methoxy group. The spectrum’s overall intensity distribution highlights the dominance of aromatic and functional group carbons, with the carbonyl and OCF3-adjacent carbons exhibiting the highest intensities due to their distinct electronic environments. This C-NMR spectrum provides critical insights into the molecule’s structural features, including the ester functionality, trifluoromethoxy substitution, and thiazole heterocycle, all of which align with the provided molecular formula and SMILES notation."

The most downfield ¹³C chemical shifts (150–170 ppm) correspond to the carbonyl carbon of the amide group (N#CCNC(=O)–) and the fluorinated aromatic ring (c1ccnc(F)n1). These carbons exhibit correlations with protons in the 6–10 ppm range, consistent with amide NH and aromatic CH environments. The fluorinated pyrimidine ring (–c1ccnc(F)n1) shows distinct cross-peaks in the ¹³C range of 120–150 ppm and ¹H range of 7–9 ppm, reflecting deshielding effects from the electronegative fluorine atom.

The spectrum displays characteristic peaks corresponding to the proton environments in the molecule. The most prominent peak at approximately 2.0 ppm is attributed to the two methyl groups (CH3) of the isopropyl ether moiety, which appear as a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent methine proton. A distinct singlet at ~1.7 ppm corresponds to the hydroxyl proton (OH) of the terminal alcohol group in the propyl chain. The methine proton of the isopropyl group resonates as a septet near 4.0 ppm, split by the six equivalent protons of the adjacent methyl groups. In the aromatic region, the benzene ring protons exhibit multiple peaks between 6.8–7.4 ppm. These signals arise from the deshielded environments of the protons ortho and para to the electron-withdrawing substituents (O-isopropyl and O-pyridyl groups). The pyridine ring protons appear downfield, with a sharp singlet at ~8.2 ppm corresponding to the proton at the 4-position of the pyridine ring, flanked by two chlorine atoms (3- and 5-positions), which significantly deshield this proton. Additional peaks at ~3.6 ppm and ~1.7 ppm are assigned to the methylene (CH2) groups of the propyl chain, with the terminal CH2 adjacent to the hydroxyl group appearing slightly upfield due to reduced shielding. The integration ratios and splitting patterns align with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of 19 protons distributed across the aromatic, aliphatic, and heteroaromatic regions. The absence of peaks outside the 0–14 ppm range and the distinct chemical shifts validate the molecular formula and connectivity provided by the SMILES notation."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the structure. The spectrum displays cross-peaks as black dots, each representing a ¹H-¹³C pair through one-bond coupling (¹JCH). Key spectral features include: 1. **Alkene Region**: A cluster of cross-peaks near 5.5–6.5 ppm (¹H) and 120–140 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the olefinic protons and carbons of the /C=C/ moiety. These signals reflect the deshielded environment of the double bond, with the trans-configuration likely influencing the chemical shifts. 2. **Ester Carbonyl Adjacent Carbon**: A cross-peak at ~4.5 ppm (¹H) and ~65 ppm (¹³C) is consistent with the protonated carbon adjacent to the ester carbonyl (O–CH–C=O) in the lactone ring. 3. **Oxygenated Carbons**: Signals between 3.5–4.2 ppm (¹H) and 60–80 ppm (¹³C) arise from carbons bearing hydroxyl groups ([C@H](O) and [C@H]1O), reflecting their electronegative substituents. 4. **Aliphatic Region**: Cross-peaks in the 1.0–2.5 ppm (¹H) and 20–40 ppm (¹³C) range correspond to the cyclopentyl group (C2CCCC2) and the ethoxy methyl (CCO). The cyclopentyl protons and carbons exhibit characteristic upfield shifts due to their saturated, shielded environment. 5. **Ethoxy Group**: A distinct cross-peak near 1.2 ppm (¹H) and ~15 ppm (¹³C) represents the terminal methyl of the ethoxy substituent, while the adjacent methylene (O–CH2) appears at ~3.5 ppm (¹H) and ~65 ppm (¹³C). The absence of cross-peaks in the carbonyl region (160–180 ppm, ¹³C) confirms the ester carbonyl is quaternary (no directly attached proton).

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C12H15ClO2 (SMILES: O=CCCCCCOc1ccc(Cl)cc1). The spectrum exhibits a molecular ion peak at m/z 227, corresponding to the intact molecule (M⁺), which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 226.7 g/mol. The base peak at m/z 113 represents the most abundant fragment, likely resulting from cleavage of the ether linkage (C–O bond) to generate a chlorophenyl cation (C₆H₄Cl⁺). This fragment is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring and the electron-withdrawing chlorine substituent. Notable peaks at m/z 155 and 157, with a 3:1 intensity ratio, indicate the presence of a chlorine atom in the fragment, consistent with the molecular formula. These peaks likely arise from a fragment retaining the chlorophenyl group and part of the aliphatic chain (e.g., C₇H₆ClO⁺). Additional significant peaks at m/z 129, 141, and 147 suggest further fragmentation of the alkyl chain or rearrangements. For instance, m/z 141 may correspond to a tropylium-like ion formed via cyclization and hydrogen rearrangement in the aliphatic portion. The peaks at m/z 71, 79, 94, 95, and 98 in the lower m/z region are characteristic of aliphatic chain fragmentation, with m/z 71 potentially representing a butyl cation (C₄H₇⁺) derived from the hexyl chain. The peak at m/z 185 (M–42) suggests loss of a C₃H₆ unit, a common fragmentation pathway for alkyl chains. Peaks at m/z 197 (M–30) and 209 (M–18) may correspond to losses of CHO and H₂O, respectively, though the latter is less typical for ethers and could involve rearrangement. The chlorine isotope pattern (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl = 3:1) is evident in fragments containing the chlorine atom, such as m/z 113/115, 155/157, and 185/187, confirming the presence of a single chlorine atom in the molecule. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 227 rules out dimerization or adduct formation.

Key observations include: 1. **Carbonyl carbons**: Two prominent peaks near 170 ppm and 155 ppm correspond to the ester carbonyl (C=O of COOCH3) and amide carbonyl (C=O of CONH2), respectively. These high-frequency shifts reflect the deshielding effects of adjacent electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms. 2. **Ester methoxy group**: A sharp peak at ~52 ppm arises from the methyl carbon (OCH3) of the ester, consistent with its typical chemical shift range (50–60 ppm). 3. **Aliphatic carbons**: Peaks between 20–40 ppm represent methylene (CH2) and methine (CH) carbons in the pyrrolidinone ring and propyl side chain. The resonance near 35 ppm likely corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the amide nitrogen, while the peak at ~25 ppm may originate from the CH2 group adjacent to the ester carbonyl. 4. **Terminal methyl group**: A peak at ~10 ppm indicates the presence of the terminal CH3 group in the propyl chain, consistent with its shielding in an aliphatic environment. The spectrum’s peak multiplicity and chemical shifts align with the molecule’s structural motifs: the pyrrolidinone ring, ester functionality, and propyl substituent. The absence of aromatic or olefinic signals (110–160 ppm) confirms the lack of unsaturated carbons. Integration of peak intensities would further validate the 11-carbon framework, though this spectrum emphasizes relative chemical environments rather than quantitative ratios.

The most prominent peak appears near 2.0 ppm, likely corresponding to the methylene protons (CH2) adjacent to the nitrogen atom in the pyridine-containing side chain. This region is influenced by the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitrogen and fluorine substituents, causing deshielding. A secondary intense peak at ~4.5 ppm may arise from the hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH), which is deshielded due to its proximity to the electronegative oxygen atom. In the aromatic region (6–8 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, consistent with the substituted pyridine ring and the fluorine atom at position 6. The fluorine substituent induces a strong deshielding effect on adjacent protons, leading to downfield shifts. The multiplet at ~7.5 ppm likely corresponds to the aromatic protons on the pyridine ring, with coupling patterns reflecting the ring’s substitution pattern. Additional smaller peaks in this region may originate from the cyclohexene ring’s vinylic protons, which are further deshielded by the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group attached to the cyclohexene moiety.

The CF3 group, while not directly observable in H-NMR, exerts an inductive effect that subtly shifts neighboring protons downfield. A notable singlet at ~10 ppm may correspond to the exchangeable proton of the hydroxyl group (OH), though its exact position could vary due to hydrogen bonding. The absence of broad coupling suggests rapid exchange with residual solvent protons. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the molecular structure, highlighting the influence of fluorine and nitrogen atoms on proton chemical shifts and the characteristic splitting patterns of aliphatic and aromatic regions."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C8H9F3N2 (SMILES: NCCc1ccc(C(F)(F)F)cn1). The spectrum displays several prominent peaks that provide insights into the molecular structure and fragmentation behavior of the compound. The most intense peak, observed at m/z 191, corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, confirming the molecular weight of 190 g/mol for C8H9F3N2. This peak serves as the primary reference for interpreting subsequent fragmentation patterns. Adjacent to the molecular ion peak, a smaller peak at m/z 174 (relative abundance ~80%) suggests a loss of 17 Da, consistent with the elimination of ammonia (NH3) from the molecular ion. This fragmentation is characteristic of compounds containing primary amine groups, such as the ethylamine side chain (-NCC-) in the given structure. A less intense peak at m/z 171 (relative abundance ~35%) indicates a loss of 20 Da, which may correspond to the removal of hydrogen fluoride (HF), a plausible event given the presence of three fluorine atoms in the trifluoromethyl group (-CF3). Further fragmentation is evident in the m/z range 146–154, where multiple peaks (146, 148, 152, 154) are observed. These peaks likely arise from cleavage of the pyridine ring or the ethylamine side chain. For instance, the peak at m/z 146 could result from the loss of a C2H4 fragment (28 Da) from the [M+H]+ ion, while the peaks at 152 and 154 may reflect alternative bond cleavages involving the -CF3 group or the ring nitrogen. The presence of these fragments highlights the stability of the pyridine ring under mass spectrometric conditions, as well as the susceptibility of the side chain to homolytic cleavage. The spectrum also shows a peak at m/z 175 (relative abundance ~20%), which may correspond to a rearrangement ion or a fragment retaining most of the molecular framework. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 100 suggests that smaller fragments, such as the trifluoromethyl cation (CF3+, 69 Da), are either not generated efficiently or are obscured by background noise. Overall, the mass spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, with key fragments reflecting the presence of the pyridine ring, -CF3 group, and ethylamine side chain. The fragmentation pathways observed—loss of NH3, HF, and hydrocarbon fragments—are consistent with the functional groups in C8H9F3N2 and provide critical evidence for its structural elucidation."

This downfield shift reflects the deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen atom. Additional intense peaks are observed between 120–140 ppm, consistent with the aromatic carbons in the molecule’s polycyclic framework. These include the chlorophenyl ring, the indole moiety, and the phenyl substituent. The quaternary carbon directly bonded to chlorine in the chlorophenyl ring likely contributes to a peak near 135 ppm, as halogen substituents typically induce significant downfield shifts. The indole’s C2 and C3 positions, particularly the latter bearing the phenyl group, appear in the 120–130 ppm range, while the indole’s pyrrole-like C2 (adjacent to NH) may exhibit a slightly upfield shift (~110–120 ppm). The sulfonamide-bearing aromatic carbon (attached to SO2NH2) is expected near 125 ppm due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the sulfonyl group. The absence of signals below 100 ppm confirms the lack of aliphatic or sp3-hybridized carbons in the structure. The multiplicity of peaks in the aromatic region reflects the molecule’s asymmetry and the distinct electronic environments created by the substituents.

The peak at approximately 12.5 ppm (1H) and 30 ppm (13C) likely arises from the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3). The high 1H shift suggests significant deshielding, possibly due to proximity to electronegative nitrogen atoms in the fused heterocyclic system. The tert-butyl carbon typically resonates near 30 ppm, consistent with this assignment. A peak at ~10 ppm (1H) and ~100 ppm (13C) corresponds to an aromatic proton in the pyrazole or pyridine ring. Such downfield 1H shifts are characteristic of protons adjacent to nitrogen atoms or in electron-deficient environments. The 13C shift of 100 ppm is typical for sp2-hybridized carbons in heteroaromatic systems. The cross-peak at ~8 ppm (1H) and ~150 ppm (13C) reflects a proton on a carbon within the pyridine ring. Pyridine carbons bonded to protons typically exhibit 13C shifts between 120–150 ppm, with the higher value here indicating a position near a nitrogen atom. The 1H shift of 8 ppm aligns with aromatic protons in such systems. Finally, the peak at ~2 ppm (1H) and ~50 ppm (13C) may correspond to a methyl group or a methylene carbon influenced by nearby nitrogen. While the molecule lacks explicit methylene groups, the 13C shift of 50 ppm suggests a carbon adjacent to a nitrogen atom, potentially in the fused ring system. The relatively upfield 1H shift (~2 ppm) could indicate an aliphatic environment or shielding effects from ring currents. Overall, the HSQC spectrum confirms the presence of four distinct CH environments, consistent with the molecular structure. The tert-butyl group, aromatic protons in the pyrazole/pyridine rings, and a nitrogen-adjacent carbon are clearly resolved, providing insights into the electronic and structural features of this heterocyclic compound."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C12H13F3O3 (SMILES: Cc1cc(OCC(F)(F)F)cc(C)c1CC(=O)O). The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 263, which aligns with the expected molecular weight of the compound (calculated as 262 g/mol, with the observed m/z 263 likely representing a protonated molecular ion [M+H]+ or an isotope contribution). The base peak at m/z 263 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Key fragment ions are observed at m/z 243, 217, 193, 181, 134, 122, 119, 93, 79, and 71. The peak at m/z 243 corresponds to the loss of a fluorine atom (Δ = 20 Da, [M−F]+), a common fragmentation pathway for trifluoromethyl ethers. The ion at m/z 217 arises from the cleavage of the carboxylic acid group (Δ = 45 Da, [M−CH2COOH]+), leaving the aromatic core with the trifluoroethoxy substituent. The fragment at m/z 193 suggests retention of the OCH2CF3 group (C8H8O2F3+), while the peak at m/z 181 likely results from further loss of CO2 (Δ = 44 Da) from this fragment. Additional diagnostic peaks include m/z 134, which may represent a rearranged aromatic fragment, and m/z 122/119, indicative of smaller fluorinated or oxygenated hydrocarbon fragments. The ion at m/z 93 corresponds to a toluene-derived fragment (C7H7+), a hallmark of aromatic systems. Lower-m/z peaks at 79 and 71 are consistent with fluorinated alkyl fragments (e.g., CF3+ and OCH2+). The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern strongly supports the assigned structure, with cleavage pathways reflecting the stability of the aromatic ring, the lability of the trifluoroethoxy group, and the carboxylic acid side chain. The relative abundances of these ions provide insights into the compound’s structural features and fragmentation behavior under mass spectrometric conditions."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbons in the structure. The spectrum displays distinct cross-peaks distributed across the ¹H chemical shift range of 14–0 ppm and the ¹³C range of 0–200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic region (¹H: 6–8.5 ppm; ¹³C: 100–150 ppm):** A dense cluster of cross-peaks in this region corresponds to the multiple aromatic rings in the molecule. The benzimidazole core (from the \"Cc1nc2c(Cl)cccc2[nH]1\" fragment) and the two phenyl rings (from the \"c1cccc(Oc2cccc(S(=O)(=O)C(C)C)c2)c1\" fragment) contribute to these signals. The chlorine substituent on the benzimidazole ring induces deshielding of adjacent protons and carbons, likely causing downfield shifts (e.g., ¹H ~7.5–8.5 ppm, ¹³C ~130–150 ppm). The ether-linked phenyl ring (Oc2cccc(S(=O)(=O)C(C)C)c2) exhibits slightly upfield shifts due to the electron-donating oxygen atom. 2. **Aliphatic region (¹H: 1–3 ppm; ¹³C: 10–50 ppm):** Cross-peaks in this region arise from the isopropyl group (S(=O)(=O)C(C)C) and the methyl group attached to the benzimidazole nitrogen (Cc1nc2...). The isopropyl group shows two distinct methyl environments (¹H ~1.2–1.5 ppm, ¹³C ~15–20 ppm) and a methine proton (¹H ~3.5 ppm, ¹³C ~50 ppm) adjacent to the sulfonyl group. The benzimidazole methyl group appears as a singlet (¹H ~2.5 ppm, ¹³C ~25 ppm) due to its direct attachment to the nitrogen. 3. **Quaternary carbon region (¹³C: 100–170 ppm):** While HSQC does not detect quaternary carbons directly, their presence is inferred from the absence of correlations in regions where aromatic carbons would typically appear. The sulfonyl carbon (S(=O)(=O)) is quaternary and not observed in the HSQC spectrum. The spectrum reflects the molecule’s structural complexity, with distinct correlations for aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic protons. The chlorine substituent and sulfonyl group introduce electronic effects that modulate chemical shifts, aiding in the differentiation of overlapping signals. Overall, the HSQC data aligns with the molecular formula and SMILES notation, confirming the presence of protonated carbons in the benzimidazole, phenyl, and isopropyl moieties."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon environments consistent with the molecular structure. Key features include a prominent peak near 150 ppm, likely corresponding to the aromatic carbons adjacent to the electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl (-CF3) groups on the benzene ring. These carbons experience significant deshielding due to the electronegativity of fluorine and the conjugated system. Additional aromatic signals appear between 120–140 ppm, assignable to the remaining aromatic carbons in the substituted benzene and pyridazine rings. A sharp peak around 160–170 ppm is indicative of the carbonyl carbon in the amide group (C=O), which is highly deshielded due to resonance and the adjacent nitrogen. The aliphatic region (0–60 ppm) shows multiple peaks, including a signal near 40–50 ppm corresponding to the methylene carbons (CH2) in the piperazine ring, which are influenced by the nearby nitrogen atoms. A distinct peak near 20 ppm likely represents the methyl group (CH3) on the aromatic ring. The trifluoromethyl groups (-CF3) themselves typically appear as singlets in the 120–130 ppm range, though their exact positions may shift slightly depending on their electronic environment. The absence of signals below 0 ppm confirms the lack of highly shielded environments, such as those found in metal-bound carbons or highly saturated systems. Overall, the spectrum reflects the structural complexity of the molecule, with clear differentiation between aromatic, carbonyl, and aliphatic carbons. The chemical shifts align with expected trends for fluorinated aromatic systems and heterocyclic amines, validating the proposed molecular framework."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C10H15NO2 (SMILES: OCCNCCOc1ccccc1). The spectrum displays two distinct clusters of cross-peaks, reflecting correlations between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei. The first cluster appears in the region of 10–12 ppm (¹H) and 100–120 ppm (¹³C), corresponding to aromatic protons and their attached carbons. These peaks arise from the benzene ring (c1ccccc1) in the molecule, where the electron-withdrawing effect of the oxygen substituent (Oc1ccccc1) slightly deshields the aromatic protons, shifting their ¹H signals downfield. The associated ¹³C shifts (100–120 ppm) are consistent with sp²-hybridized aromatic carbons, though slightly upfield compared to typical unsubstituted benzene due to the oxygen’s resonance donation. The second cluster, observed at 3–5 ppm (¹H) and 40–60 ppm (¹³C), corresponds to aliphatic methylene (CH₂) groups. The peaks near 4–5 ppm (¹H) and 60 ppm (¹³C) are attributed to the O-CH₂ groups adjacent to oxygen atoms in the OCCNCCO backbone. These protons experience moderate deshielding due to the electronegative oxygen, while their carbons resonate in the typical range for oxygen-bound sp³ carbons. The peaks at 3–4 ppm (¹H) and 40–50 ppm (¹³C) correlate with the CH₂ groups adjacent to the nitrogen atom (N-CH₂), where the nitrogen’s lower electronegativity compared to oxygen results in slightly upfield shifts for both nuclei. Notably, the absence of cross-peaks in the 6–8 ppm (¹H) and 120–140 ppm (¹³C) regions suggests that either the aromatic proton-carbon correlations are obscured by overlapping signals or the spectrum’s acquisition parameters prioritize resolution in the observed regions. The HSQC data aligns with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of a phenoxyethyl group (Oc1ccccc1) and a diethanolamine-derived chain (OCCNCCO), with all expected proton-carbon correlations accounted for in the aliphatic and aromatic domains. This analysis underscores the utility of HSQC in mapping direct H-C connectivity for structural elucidation."

The spectrum exhibits a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 346, corresponding to the intact protonated molecule [M+H]+, consistent with the molecular weight of C19H23NO5 (calculated monoisotopic mass: 345 Da). The base peak at m/z 286 represents the most abundant fragment, indicating a stable cationic species formed via fragmentation of the parent ion. This fragment likely arises from the loss of a neutral CO2Me group (60 Da) from the molecular ion, a common pathway for ester-containing compounds under electron ionization. Additional key fragments include a strong peak at m/z 91, characteristic of the tropylium ion (C7H7+), which originates from the benzyl ester moiety (C(=O)OCc3ccccc3) via cleavage of the ester bond and rearrangement. A moderate peak at m/z 210 suggests the loss of the entire benzyl ester group (136 Da) from the molecular ion, leaving a fragment consistent with the remaining tropane-derived structure. Peaks at m/z 150 and 238 further support structural features of the bicyclic core, likely resulting from fragmentation of the tropane ring system (N2C[C@@H]1C[C@H]2CC(=O)[C@@H](C1)) and adjacent carbonyl groups. The spectrum also shows minor peaks at m/z 287 and 288, which may correspond to isotopic contributions (e.g., 13C or 15N substitutions) or secondary fragmentation pathways. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 346 confirms the molecular ion assignment, while the relative abundance of lower-mass fragments reflects the molecule's susceptibility to ester and ring cleavage under ionization conditions. These spectral features align with the structural motifs of the SMILES notation, including the methyl ester (COOCH3), benzyl ester (COOCH2C6H5), and tropane-derived nitrogen-containing bicyclic framework. The fragmentation pattern provides critical insights into the molecule's functional groups and connectivity, aiding in its structural elucidation."

This confirms the molecular weight of 370.78 g/mol calculated from the given formula. The presence of chlorine is evident from isotope peaks at m/z 155 and 157 (3:1 ratio), indicative of a fragment containing a single chlorine atom. A prominent peak at m/z 91, a characteristic tropylium ion, suggests fragmentation of the benzyl group attached to the nitrogen atom.

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 14 to -2 ppm, with key features reflecting the molecule's structural complexity. A prominent singlet at ~13 ppm corresponds to the sulfonamide (NHSO2) proton, a highly deshielded environment due to the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~11 ppm likely represents the amide proton (NH) in the thiazole-2,4-dione ring, stabilized by resonance with the carbonyl groups. Between 8–10 ppm, multiple peaks arise from aromatic protons on the pyridine and furan rings. The pyridine ring (c2cncc3...) contributes protons in the 8.5–9.5 ppm range, with coupling patterns reflecting meta- and para-substitution. The furan ring (oc23) introduces additional signals, typically slightly upfield (~7–8 ppm), though substituent effects from the adjacent thiazole ring may shift these peaks. A notable peak at ~5.5 ppm suggests a methine proton (CH) in a deshielded environment, likely the vinylic proton on the thiazole ring (/C=C4\\), influenced by the electron-withdrawing sulfur and carbonyl groups. The piperazine ring (N1CCN...CC1) contributes aliphatic protons in the 2.5–3.5 ppm region, though these may overlap or appear as broad multiplets due to conformational flexibility and coupling with adjacent nitrogens. The spectrum’s low-intensity baseline noise and sharp peak resolution indicate a well-dissolved sample, with no significant impurities.

The peak at m/z 127 likely results from homolytic cleavage of the C–S bond adjacent to the sulfoxide group (S=O), generating a fragment retaining the oxygenated aromatic ring and part of the alkyl chain. The m/z 175 and 187 peaks suggest successive losses of small alkyl groups (e.g., C4H8 or C5H10) from the parent ion, consistent with the branched isopentyl (CC(C)C) substituent on the sulfur atom.

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks in the aromatic region, consistent with the molecule's polyaromatic and nitrogen-rich structure. The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at approximately 8.0 ppm with high intensity, likely corresponding to a proton in a highly conjugated aromatic environment, such as a pyridine or pyrimidine ring. This peak's downfield position suggests deshielding by adjacent electronegative nitrogen atoms or electron-withdrawing substituents. Additional peaks are observed between 10.0–12.0 ppm, a region typically associated with strongly deshielded aromatic protons or NH protons. The peak at ~11.5 ppm may arise from protons on a pyridine ring adjacent to the amino group (-NH2) or from protons on the central pyrimidine ring, which is flanked by two nitrogen atoms. The peak at ~10.5 ppm could correspond to protons on the terminal pyridine ring bearing the amino group, where the electron-withdrawing effect of the -NH2 group further deshields the protons. The spectrum also shows weaker signals near 12.0 ppm, which may represent minor impurities or exchangeable protons (e.g., -NH2) broadened by hydrogen bonding or rapid exchange with the solvent. The absence of significant splitting patterns suggests either rapid rotation around aromatic linkages or symmetry in the molecule that renders certain protons equivalent. The fluorine substituents (CF3 groups) in the molecule do not directly contribute to the H-NMR spectrum but exert strong electron-withdrawing effects, indirectly deshielding nearby aromatic protons and contributing to the observed downfield shifts. The overall spectral pattern reflects a rigid, conjugated system with multiple aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, consistent with the provided SMILES structure. Integration of peak areas would be required to confirm the exact number of protons in each environment, but the chemical shifts and intensities align with the expected electronic and steric effects of the molecule's functional groups."

The benzyl ether moiety (OCc₂c(F)ccc(F)c₂F) and pyrazole-heterocycle (n2nc(C3CC3)c(C(=O)O)c2c1) contribute to these signals. The electron-withdrawing fluorine substituents on the benzene ring deshield adjacent protons and carbons, shifting their resonances downfield (e.g., ¹H ~8–10 ppm; ¹³C ~130–150 ppm). 2. **Methoxy-Benzyl Group (¹H: ~4.5–5 ppm; ¹³C: ~60–70 ppm):** A distinct cross-peak pair near 4.5 ppm (¹H) and 65 ppm (¹³C) arises from the OCH₂ group linking the benzene ring to the heterocycle. This methylene group exhibits characteristic upfield proton shifts due to its aliphatic nature. 3. **Methyl Group (¹H: ~2–3 ppm; ¹³C: ~20–30 ppm):** A cross-peak at ~2.5 ppm (¹H) and 22 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methyl substituent (C19H15F3N2O3) on the pyrazole ring. 4. **Cyclopropyl Group (¹H: ~1–2 ppm; ¹³C: ~10–20 ppm):** Peaks near 1.5 ppm (¹H) and 15 ppm (¹³C) reflect the cyclopropyl ring (C3CC3), where ring strain causes slight deshielding of protons. 5. **Carboxylic Acid (¹H: ~12–13 ppm; ¹³C: ~170–180 ppm):** While the carboxylic acid proton (COOH) typically appears as a broad singlet in ¹H NMR, its direct correlation to the carbonyl carbon (¹³C ~175 ppm) may be weak or absent in HSQC due to rapid exchange or relaxation effects. The spectrum confirms the presence of all protonated carbons in the structure, including aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic environments. Fluorine-induced deshielding and the distinct chemical shifts of the cyclopropyl and methoxy groups align with the assigned structure. Quaternary carbons (e.g., carboxylic acid carbon, fluorinated aromatic carbons) lack cross-peaks, as expected in HSQC experiments. This analysis supports the molecular formula and connectivity provided by the SMILES notation."

The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption bands corresponding to functional groups in the structure. A sharp peak at ~3500 cm⁻¹ suggests N-H stretching, consistent with the secondary amide (phthalimide) group. Two strong carbonyl (C=O) stretches near 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ correspond to the phthalimide and lactam moieties, respectively. The 1600–1450 cm⁻¹ region shows multiple aromatic C=C stretching vibrations, reflecting the benzene rings in the phthalimide and brominated phenyl groups. A broad band near 1250 cm⁻¹ is attributed to C-O stretching in the ether linkage (CCCC-O-c1...). The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) displays complex patterns from C-N stretching, ring deformations, and C-Br bending vibrations, though the latter are weak due to bromine’s low electronegativity.

The spectrum displays distinct chemical shifts that correlate with the structural features of the molecule. The most prominent peak occurs at ~6.0 ppm, which corresponds to aromatic protons from the two benzene rings in the structure. The chlorine substituent on one ring and the trifluoromethyl group on the other create electron-withdrawing effects, deshielding adjacent aromatic protons and contributing to this downfield signal. A sharp, intense peak at ~10.0 ppm is characteristic of amide N–H protons, likely arising from the two amide linkages in the molecule. These protons are highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl groups. A smaller peak near ~12.0 ppm may indicate a highly deshielded N–H proton, possibly from the primary amine group on the trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatic ring, which could experience strong hydrogen bonding or solvent interactions. Additional minor peaks between 2.0–4.0 ppm correspond to aliphatic protons in the piperidine ring and methylene (CH₂) groups, which appear upfield due to their saturated, electron-rich environments.

The spectrum displays four distinct cross-peaks, indicating four protonated carbon environments directly correlated with their attached hydrogens. The x-axis (¹H) spans 14 to -2 ppm, while the y-axis (¹³C) spans 0 to 200 ppm. The three peaks clustered near 7 ppm (¹H) and 10–14 ppm (¹³C) correspond to deshielded aliphatic or vinylic protons attached to carbons in a strongly electron-withdrawing environment. These shifts suggest protons adjacent to the nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]) or conjugated with the thiazole ring’s π-system. The proximity of these peaks in the ¹H dimension implies similar electronic environments, likely arising from protons on carbons near the C=C double bond or the nitro-substituted carbon. The fourth peak at ~2 ppm (¹H) and ~4 ppm (¹³C) represents a highly shielded methyl or methylene group, likely the terminal CH₃ group in the CC(=Cc1cscn1)[N+](=O)[O-] structure. The unusually low ¹³C shift (4 ppm) is characteristic of a methyl carbon adjacent to an electronegative atom, consistent with the nitro group’s inductive effects. The absence of peaks in the aromatic ¹³C region (100–150 ppm) indicates that the thiazole ring’s carbons are either non-protonated (e.g., quaternary) or their correlations fall outside the plotted range. The observed peaks collectively reflect the molecule’s hybrid aliphatic-aromatic character, with the nitro group and thiazole ring dominating the electronic environments of the observed protonated carbons. This spectrum provides critical insights into the spatial and electronic relationships between hydrogen and carbon atoms in this nitro-thiazole derivative."

Sharp, intense peaks in the 2900–3100 cm⁻¹ region indicate C-H stretching vibrations from aromatic and aliphatic carbons, including the furan ring and ethyl ester moiety. The most prominent feature is a strong, sharp absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹, consistent with the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the ester group. This peak's position and intensity align with the ethyl ester functionality in the structure. Additional peaks in the 1500–1600 cm⁻¹ range correspond to C=C stretching vibrations in the aromatic furan and imidazole rings, while weaker bands near 1200–1300 cm⁻¹ may arise from C-N stretching in the imidazole ring and C-O stretching in the ester and hydroxymethyl groups.

This chemical shift reflects the deshielded environment of these protons due to proximity to the electron-withdrawing sulfonamide group. Aromatic protons from the benzyl moiety (c1ccccc1) appear as a multiplet in the 7.2–7.8 ppm region, integrating to 5H, typical for a monosubstituted benzene ring. The sulfonamide NH proton is expected to resonate as a broad singlet in the 5–7 ppm range, though it may overlap with aromatic signals or appear as a weak feature due to exchange broadening. The morpholine ring (N1CCOCC1) contributes two sets of multiplets: one near 3.5 ppm (4H) for the methylene groups adjacent to the oxygen atoms, and another near 2.5 ppm (4H) for the methylene groups adjacent to the nitrogen.

A prominent peak near 200 ppm is observed, consistent with the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ketone group in the 12-membered ring. The aromatic carbons of the phenyl ring (c1ccccc1) appear as multiple signals between 120–140 ppm, reflecting the deshielded nature of sp²-hybridized carbons in the benzene ring. These peaks are split due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the sulfonyl group (-SO₂-), which creates distinct electronic environments for the ortho, meta, and para carbons.

This chemical shift range (6.5–8.0 ppm) is characteristic of protons in a substituted aromatic system. A smaller peak at ~7.5 ppm likely corresponds to a proton ortho to the nitrile group, which experiences additional deshielding from the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the C#N moiety. In the aliphatic region, a singlet at ~4.0 ppm is attributed to the methoxy group (OCH3), as the oxygen atom deshields the methyl protons, shifting them downfield. A triplet-like resonance at ~2.5 ppm corresponds to the methylene group (CH2) of the ethyl substituent, which is split by coupling with the adjacent CH3 group. The methyl group of the ethyl chain (CH3CH2–) is expected to appear as a triplet near 1.2 ppm, though this peak may overlap with baseline noise or solvent signals in the spectrum.

The spectrum displays several prominent peaks across the m/z range, with the base peak at m/z 379 and a significant peak at m/z 423. The molecular ion peak, corresponding to the intact molecule, is absent, suggesting extensive fragmentation under ionization conditions. The base peak at m/z 379 likely represents a major fragment formed via cleavage of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group (C5H9O2, 101 Da), resulting in a loss of 101 from the molecular ion (478.5 Da → 377.5 Da), with the observed m/z 379 indicating possible adduct formation or isotopic contributions.

Additional peaks at m/z 336 and 377 further support stepwise degradation of the parent molecule, with the latter aligning with the Boc-cleaved fragment. The absence of low-m/z peaks (<100) suggests minimal small-molecule losses (e.g., CO2 or tert-butyl radicals). Overall, the fragmentation pattern reflects the stability of the chlorophenyl and sulfonyl groups under ionization, while the Boc and piperazine moieties contribute to mid-range fragments. This spectrum highlights the structural complexity of the molecule and the utility of mass spectrometry in elucidating its breakdown pathways."

A distinct peak near 700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of aromatic C–H out-of-plane bending, supporting the presence of a monosubstituted benzene ring. The absence of carbonyl (C=O) stretching bands near 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of ketone or ester functionalities in the structure. Overall, the spectral features align with the ether-rich, aromatic-aliphatic hybrid structure of COCCCCCOCc1ccccc1."

Key features include a prominent multiplet at 7.2–7.5 ppm, corresponding to the aromatic protons of the three phenyl rings (c1ccccc1, c3ccccc3, and the substituted phenyl in Nc3ccccc3-c3ccccc3). The integration and splitting patterns suggest overlapping signals from these electronically distinct aromatic environments. A sharp singlet at ~5.5 ppm is consistent with the vinyl proton (C=CH) adjacent to the phenyl ring in the C=C(c1ccccc1) moiety. The region between 4.2–4.5 ppm shows a doublet (J ≈ 12 Hz) assignable to the benzylic protons (CH2 adjacent to oxygen in the COC2 group), while the OCH2 protons of the dioxolane ring (OOC1COC2) appear as a triplet at ~3.8 ppm. The cyclohexane ring (CCC(Nc3ccccc3-c3ccccc3)CC2) contributes aliphatic protons between 1.5–2.5 ppm, with the NH proton likely appearing as a broad singlet near 2.0 ppm due to hydrogen bonding. The peroxide (OO1) and ether (COC2) groups deshield nearby protons, shifting their resonances downfield.

The spectrum displays several distinct peaks corresponding to protons in different chemical environments. A prominent singlet at 12.8 ppm is attributed to the acetamide NH proton, which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. A broad peak at 11.2 ppm likely corresponds to the aniline NH2 group, which often exhibits variable chemical shifts due to exchange broadening and hydrogen bonding. Another singlet at 10.2 ppm may arise from a proton on the pyridine ring adjacent to the acetamide group, influenced by the ring's electron-deficient nature. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), multiple peaks reflect the protons of the pyridine and benzene rings. The pyridine ring protons (positions 3, 5, and 6) appear as a multiplet between 7.8–8.5 ppm, while the para-substituted benzene ring protons (positions 2, 3, 5, and 6) generate two doublets around 7.0–7.5 ppm due to their symmetric substitution pattern. A singlet at 3.5 ppm corresponds to the methyl group of the acetyl moiety, slightly deshielded by the adjacent carbonyl. The absence of peaks below 2 ppm confirms no aliphatic protons beyond the acetyl methyl group. The integration ratios and splitting patterns align with the molecular structure, supporting the assignment of functional groups and their connectivity. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the molecule’s aromaticity, hydrogen-bonding interactions, and the distinct electronic environments of its protons."

A cluster of peaks around 6 ppm (^1H) and 50 ppm (^13C) indicates methylene protons (CH₂) in the butyl chain, with the ^13C shift reflecting proximity to the sulfonyl sulfur. Peaks at ~4 ppm (^1H) and 30–40 ppm (^13C) may arise from protons on carbons directly bonded to nitrogen (e.g., the N-methyl group in the imidazole ring), as nitrogen deshields adjacent carbons.

The presence of a chlorine atom is confirmed by the isotope pattern, where peaks at m/z 273 and 275 (not labeled but implied by the chlorine isotopic ratio of 3:1 for 35Cl:37Cl) are observed. Key fragment ions provide insight into the structural decomposition pathways. A prominent peak at m/z 244 (273–29) suggests the loss of a neutral fragment such as CHO (29 Da), likely originating from the carbonyl group or adjacent methylene moiety. Additional fragments include m/z 153 and 155, which exhibit a 3:1 intensity ratio consistent with the retention of the chlorine atom in these substructures. The 153/155 pair likely corresponds to a chlorinated benzene ring fragment, possibly retaining part of the fused heterocyclic system. The peak at m/z 106 is characteristic of the imidazole-nitrile subunit (C5H3N4), formed via cleavage of the lactam ring and loss of the chlorinated aromatic portion. This fragment is stabilized by the nitrile group and aromaticity of the imidazole ring. Other notable peaks, such as m/z 131 and 193, suggest further breakdown of the heterocyclic core, with 193 potentially representing a loss of the nitrile group (–C#N, 26 Da) from the molecular ion. The high-abundance peaks in the 200–250 m/z range (e.g., 202, 218, 231) indicate complex fragmentation involving rearrangements or stepwise losses of small neutrals (e.g., HCN, CO). The peak at m/z 244, combined with the absence of significant peaks above 273, confirms the molecular ion’s stability and the absence of larger oligomers. Overall, the spectrum reflects the structural features of the benzodiazepine-like core, with fragmentation patterns dominated by cleavage of the lactam ring, loss of the nitrile group, and retention of the chlorinated aromatic system in key fragments. These observations are consistent with the proposed molecular formula and SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks that correlate with the structural features of the compound. The most prominent resonance at approximately 10 ppm (singlet) corresponds to a highly deshielded aromatic proton on the benzene ring, likely adjacent to the electron-withdrawing lactam carbonyl group at position 4. This deshielding effect is typical for protons near strong electron-withdrawing substituents. A multiplet centered at ~7.5 ppm (4H) arises from the four aromatic protons of the pyridine ring, which typically resonate in this region due to the ring's electron-deficient nature. Two singlets at ~4 ppm (2H) and ~3.5 ppm (2H) are attributed to the methylene (CH₂) groups in the lactam ring. The upfield shift of the 3.5 ppm peak reflects the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl, while the 4 ppm peak corresponds to the CH₂ linked to the pyridine nitrogen, which experiences deshielding from the adjacent heteroatom. The intense singlet at ~2 ppm (9H) integrates to three methyl groups: the propyne methyl (CC#C–CH₃) and the two methyl substituents on the benzene ring. These methyl groups are in electronically similar environments, leading to overlapping signals. The absence of signals in the aldehyde (9–10 ppm) or amide NH (6–8 ppm) regions confirms the lack of such functional groups in the structure. The spectrum’s simplicity in the 5–6 ppm range indicates no vinylic or olefinic protons, consistent with the molecule’s aromatic and alkyne-dominated framework.

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C14H22N2 (SMILES: CC(C)N1CCC(Nc2ccccc2)CC1). The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at *m/z* 219, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]⁺, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 218 g/mol for C14H22N2. The base peak at *m/z* 219 indicates high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Key fragment ions are observed at *m/z* 177, 126, 161, 132, and 98, reflecting characteristic cleavage patterns of the molecule’s structure. The peak at *m/z* 177 represents a loss of 42 Da from the molecular ion, likely corresponding to the elimination of a propene (C3H6) fragment from the isopropyl group attached to the nitrogen. This is consistent with the structure’s tertiary amine, which often undergoes α-cleavage to generate stable carbocations. A significant fragment at *m/z* 126 suggests further degradation of the piperidine ring system, potentially via C-N bond cleavage adjacent to the aromatic substituent, yielding a fragment retaining the aniline moiety (C6H5NH) and part of the aliphatic chain. Additional peaks at *m/z* 161 (loss of 58 Da) and 132 (loss of 87 Da) may arise from sequential fragmentation of the piperidine ring or elimination of smaller hydrocarbon units (e.g., C4H10 or C5H11). The fragment at *m/z* 98 could correspond to a piperidinium ion (C5H10N⁺), a common stable fragment in nitrogen-containing heterocycles. Smaller peaks at *m/z* 55, 72, 84, and 94 are likely aliphatic hydrocarbon fragments (e.g., C4H7⁺, C5H12N⁺) derived from the isopropyl or piperidine groups. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule: a piperidine ring substituted with an isopropyl group and an aniline moiety. The stability of the aromatic ring is reflected in the retention of the phenyl group in several fragments, while the tertiary amine facilitates cleavage at adjacent bonds. This analysis underscores the utility of mass spectrometry in elucidating structural motifs through characteristic ion fragmentation."

The spectrum displays several key peaks that correlate with the molecular structure and fragmentation patterns expected for this compound. The most prominent peak, observed at m/z 460, corresponds to the molecular ion (M+), confirming the molecular weight of 460 g/mol as calculated from the given formula. This peak serves as the primary indicator of the intact molecule's presence. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 373, 350, 306, and 263, which arise from characteristic fragmentation pathways. The peak at m/z 373 (relative abundance ~25%) likely results from the loss of a chlorine atom (35 Da) and a small neutral fragment, such as HCl or a hydroxyl group, from the molecular ion. The peak at m/z 350 (relative abundance ~15%) may correspond to a further fragmentation of the core structure, potentially involving cleavage of the morpholine ring (N3CCOCC3) or the cyclohexyl moiety (C[C@@H]1CC[C@@H]...CC1). The peak at m/z 306 (relative abundance ~10%) suggests a stable fragment retaining the chlorinated phenyl group (-c4cccc(Cl)c4) and portions of the fused bicyclic heterocyclic system (nc3nc(Cl)nc...c32). The peak at m/z 263 (relative abundance ~5%) is consistent with a smaller fragment, possibly the central bicyclic system stripped of peripheral substituents. Notably, the absence of peaks above m/z 460 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity, while the distribution of lower-mass fragments aligns with the compound’s structural complexity. The spectrum’s features reflect the molecule’s functional groups, including the chlorine substituents (evidenced by peaks at m/z 373 and 306) and the heterocyclic framework (retained in multiple fragments). The observed fragmentation pattern supports the assigned structure, demonstrating the stability of the aromatic and heterocyclic components under ionization conditions. This MASS spectrum provides critical evidence for the molecular identity and structural integrity of C23H27Cl2N5O."

The spectrum displays characteristic proton resonances corresponding to the structural features of this compound. The most prominent peaks appear in the aliphatic region (0–4 ppm) and aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), with notable signals at 3.0 ppm (intensity ~0.35) and 3.2 ppm (intensity ~0.23), likely arising from the two equivalent methylene (-CH2-) groups adjacent to the acetate esters (COOCH2) in the molecule. These peaks exhibit high intensity due to the six equivalent protons from the two acetate-protected hydroxymethyl groups. In the aromatic region, a cluster of overlapping multiplets between 6.5–8.5 ppm (intensities ~0.05–0.10) reflects the presence of the naphthalene and phenyl rings. The naphthalene moiety (c2cccc3c(O)cccc23) contributes to the complex splitting pattern, with protons at positions ortho and para to the hydroxyl group experiencing deshielding effects, shifting their resonances downfield. The phenyl ring (c1ccc(-c2...)cc1) also contributes to this region, with its protons appearing as a broad singlet or multiplet due to coupling with adjacent substituents. A minor singlet near 2.1 ppm (intensity ~0.03) corresponds to the methyl protons of the acetamide group (NHCOCH3), which are shielded compared to the ester methyl groups. Additional weak signals between 1.0–2.5 ppm (intensities <0.05) may arise from the methylene protons in the central CCc1... chain, though their low intensity suggests overlap or partial signal suppression. The absence of peaks below 0 ppm and the lack of broad signals in the 10–12 ppm range confirm the absence of strongly acidic protons (e.g., carboxylic acids or free phenolic OH, which may be intramolecularly hydrogen-bonded or solvent-exchanged). The integration and splitting patterns align with the molecular symmetry and substitution pattern, particularly the two acetate esters and the extended aromatic system. The high-field acetate methyl peaks (not shown in this spectrum) typically appear near 2.0 ppm but may be absent here due to baseline suppression or solvent effects. Overall, the spectrum reflects the compound’s structural complexity, with distinct regions corresponding to its functional groups and aromatic systems."

The spectrum displays several prominent peaks across the m/z range of 50–252, with the molecular ion peak observed at m/z 252, corresponding to the intact molecule [M]+. The base peak (highest relative abundance) appears at m/z 194, indicating a highly stable fragment ion. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 224, 195, 196, 178, 150, 152, 137, 124, 106, 107, and 108. The peak at m/z 194 suggests a loss of 58 Da from the molecular ion, likely corresponding to a neutral fragment such as C3H6O2 (e.g., ethyl acetate or a related ester-derived moiety). This fragmentation is consistent with the cleavage of one of the ester groups (C(=O)OCC) in the molecule. The peak at m/z 224 (loss of 28 Da from the molecular ion) may arise from the elimination of a CO group or similar small neutral fragment. The cluster of peaks between m/z 150–196 includes ions at 150, 152, 160, 178, and 179, which may result from further fragmentation of the pyridine ring or additional ester group cleavages. For example, the m/z 150 peak could correspond to a fragment retaining the pyridine core with one ester group, while the m/z 178 peak might involve a rearrangement or loss of a methyl group (CH3) from a larger fragment. Lower-m/z peaks at 96, 106, 107, and 108 are characteristic of smaller aromatic or aliphatic fragments, potentially originating from the pyridine ring or alkyl substituents. The peak at m/z 106 could represent a tropylium-like ion or a substituted pyridine fragment. The isotopic peaks (e.g., 195, 196) reflect natural isotopic abundance, with the m/z 195 peak likely corresponding to a 13C isotope contribution from the m/z 194 ion. Similarly, the m/z 179 peak may arise from a 13C-containing fragment of the m/z 178 ion. Overall, the fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the two ester groups and the substituted pyridine ring. The spectrum demonstrates typical behavior of an ester-containing heterocycle under electron ionization, with dominant cleavage at the ester linkages and subsequent decomposition of the aromatic core."

    "text": "This is an IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H8ClFN2O2 (SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1nc2cc(F)ccc2nc1Cl). The spectrum displays characteristic absorption features corresponding to the functional groups and vibrational modes of this compound. The most prominent peak, located near 1700 cm⁻¹, is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the ester group (CCOC=O). Ester carbonyls typically absorb in the 1735–1750 cm⁻¹ range, though conjugation with the adjacent aromatic ring may slightly lower the frequency here. A strong absorption around 1200 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the C–O single-bond stretch of the ester, consistent with the asymmetric stretching mode of the C–O–C linkage. The aromatic ring in the molecule produces multiple peaks in the 1600–1450 cm⁻¹ region, arising from C=C stretching vibrations. These bands are split due to the substitution pattern of the ring, with fluorine and the heterocyclic moiety influencing the electron density and vibrational frequencies. A distinct peak near 1100 cm⁻¹ is likely associated with the C–F stretching vibration, as carbon-fluorine bonds typically absorb in the 1000–1350 cm⁻¹ range. Additionally, a band near 800 cm⁻¹ may correspond to the C–Cl stretch, which generally appears below 850 cm⁻¹ due to the heavy chlorine atom. The C–H stretching vibrations of the aromatic ring are observed just above 3000 cm⁻¹, while the aliphatic C–H stretches of the ethoxy group (CH2CH3) appear slightly lower, near 2900 cm⁻¹. Notably, the absence of broad O–H or N–H stretches (typically 3200–3600 cm⁻¹) aligns with the lack of hydroxyl or amine groups in the structure. The spectrum also lacks significant peaks in the 2100–2250 cm⁻¹ region, confirming the absence of nitrile (C≡N) or alkyne (C≡C) groups. Overall, the IR spectrum provides clear evidence of the ester functionality, aromatic system, and halogen substituents in C11H8ClFN2O2, with vibrational modes consistent with the proposed structure."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the molecule's diverse functional groups and structural complexity. The most prominent peaks appear near 200 ppm, corresponding to the three carbonyl carbons (C=O) in the molecule: two ketones adjacent to the tert-butyl group and one ketone within the pyrrolidine ring. These high-field shifts are characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons, which experience strong deshielding due to their double-bonded oxygen atoms. In the aromatic region (110–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed, reflecting the two benzene rings in the structure. The signals near 130–140 ppm likely correspond to the substituted aromatic carbons in the cinnamyl ether moiety (C=Cc1ccc(OCc2ccccc2)cc1), while the peaks around 120–130 ppm arise from the unsubstituted phenyl ring (c2ccccc2). The oxygen-bound benzylic carbon (OCc2ccccc2) appears as a distinct peak near 70 ppm, consistent with its sp³ hybridization and proximity to the electronegative oxygen atom. The aliphatic region (0–60 ppm) contains several resonances. The tert-butyl group (CCC(C)(C)) generates a peak near 30 ppm for its methyl carbons and a slightly upfield signal (~25 ppm) for the central quaternary carbon. The pyrrolidine ring (N1CCCC1) contributes peaks in the 20–50 ppm range, with the carbon adjacent to nitrogen (C-N) appearing downfield (~45 ppm) due to nitrogen's electron-withdrawing effect. The propenyl chain (CCC=C) exhibits signals near 30–40 ppm for the CH₂ groups and a characteristic vinylic carbon (~130 ppm) for the C=C double bond. Notably, the spectrum lacks peaks below 10 ppm, confirming the absence of isolated methyl groups not adjacent to electronegative atoms. The overall distribution of peaks aligns with the molecule's structural features, including its conjugated system, ether linkage, and multiple carbonyl functionalities. This C-NMR spectrum provides critical insights into the carbon framework, enabling validation of the proposed structure and identification of key functional groups."

The most prominent feature is a sharp singlet at 6 ppm with high intensity, likely corresponding to the aromatic protons on the substituted benzene ring (c1cccc...c1). This region is influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent oxime (ON=C) and ether (Oc2...) substituents, which deshield the aromatic protons and shift their signals downfield. Additional peaks are observed at 2 ppm and 3 ppm, which can be assigned to the aliphatic protons of the ethyl ester group (CCOC=O) and the methoxy groups (OC) attached to the pyrimidine ring (c2nc...n2). The 2 ppm peak may represent the methyl group (CH3) of the ethyl ester, while the 3 ppm peak aligns with the two methoxy groups on the pyrimidine ring, which typically appear as singlets in this region due to their symmetry. A moderate singlet at 8 ppm corresponds to the oxime proton (O-N=CH-), which is highly deshielded due to the electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The smaller peak at 10 ppm may arise from the proton adjacent to the oxime nitrogen (CH in O-N=CH-), though this environment is less common and could also indicate minor impurities or solvent effects. The absence of peaks above 12 ppm suggests no carboxylic acid or strongly acidic protons are present, consistent with the ester and ether functionalities in the structure. The overall splitting patterns and chemical shifts align with the molecular framework, where aromatic, aliphatic, and heteroatom-bound protons contribute to the observed spectral features.

Additional fragment ions at m/z 203 and 204 may arise from isotopic contributions (e.g., 13C or 18O) or minor structural rearrangements during ionization. The peak at m/z 161 represents a stable fragment retaining the fluorophenyl moiety (C6H4F, 95 Da) and part of the pyridine N-oxide core, possibly formed via cleavage of the C-C bond between the pyridine and carboxylic acid groups.

The most prominent peak appears near 150 ppm, which is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O) in a carbamate functional group. This aligns with the carbonyl group in the carbamate moiety (O=C-N) of the structure. Adjacent to this, a peak at approximately 80 ppm likely corresponds to the quaternary carbon of the tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3) bonded to the oxygen atom, as such carbons typically resonate in the 70–90 ppm range due to deshielding by the electronegative oxygen. A cluster of peaks between 20–30 ppm represents the methyl groups of the tert-butyl moiety, which are shielded and appear in the aliphatic region. The cyclohexane ring carbons (C1–C6) contribute to peaks in the 20–50 ppm range, with the carbon directly bonded to the nitrogen (C1) appearing slightly downfield (~50 ppm) due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent nitrogen atom. The two carbons in the ethoxy side chain (CCO) are also distinguishable: the CH2 group bonded to oxygen (OCH2) resonates around 60 ppm, while the adjacent CH2 group appears near 30 ppm. A notable peak at ~200 ppm may indicate an artifact or a minor impurity, as the structure does not contain a ketone or aldehyde group. However, if genuine, it could suggest a transient tautomer or an oxidized species, though this is speculative. The absence of peaks above 200 ppm confirms no aromatic or highly conjugated systems are present. Overall, the spectrum reflects the expected carbon environments for the given structure, with clear signals for the carbamate carbonyl, tert-butyl group, cyclohexane ring, and ethoxy side chain."

The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides a correlation between directly bonded 1H and 13C nuclei, enabling the assignment of protonated carbon signals. The x-axis represents 1H chemical shifts (ppm), spanning from -2 to 14 ppm, while the y-axis corresponds to 13C chemical shifts (ppm), ranging from 0 to 200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6–8 ppm, 1H; 100–160 ppm, 13C):** A cluster of peaks in this region reflects the presence of multiple aromatic systems. The molecule contains a benzoxazole moiety (c3cc(F)ccc23), a chlorophenyl group (c2cccc(Cl)c2), and a phenyl ring linked via an ether (COc1ccc...). The fluorine substituent on the benzoxazole ring induces deshielding, likely contributing to downfield 1H shifts (~7.5–8.0 ppm) and corresponding 13C shifts (~140–160 ppm). The chlorophenyl group’s protons appear at slightly upfield 1H positions (~6.8–7.2 ppm) with 13C shifts near 120–135 ppm. 2. **Aliphatic Region (0–4 ppm, 1H; 20–70 ppm, 13C):** Peaks in this area correspond to the piperidine ring (N1CCC...CC1) and the CH2 groups adjacent to oxygen atoms. The OCH2 group (COc1ccc...) exhibits a 1H shift near 4.0–4.5 ppm and a 13C shift ~65–70 ppm. The CH2 groups in the piperidine ring appear at ~1.5–3.0 ppm (1H) and ~25–50 ppm (13C), with the N-CH2 group likely shifted slightly downfield (~3.0–3.5 ppm) due to proximity to the nitrogen. 3. **High-Field Aromatic Protons (10–12 ppm, 1H; 110–130 ppm, 13C):** These peaks may arise from protons ortho to the oxazole nitrogen or fluorine, experiencing strong deshielding. The benzoxazole’s C2 proton (adjacent to N and O) is a plausible candidate for the most downfield 1H signal (~11 ppm). 4. **Low-Intensity Peaks (5–6 ppm, 1H; 100–120 ppm, 13C):** These could correspond to the CH group in the benzoxazole ring (c2noc3...), where the proton is coupled to both nitrogen and oxygen. The spectrum confirms the presence of all protonated carbons, with quaternary carbons (e.g., aromatic carbons bearing Cl or F, or the benzoxazole C3) absent due to the HSQC experiment’s design. The fluorine atom’s electronegativity and the chlorine substituent’s inductive effects are reflected in the chemical shift dispersion of adjacent protons and carbons. Overall, the HSQC spectrum aligns with the structural complexity of C27H26ClFN2O4, showcasing distinct correlations for aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic environments."

A prominent singlet at ~10 ppm is attributed to the amide NH proton (NC2CCCCC2), which is deshielded due to hydrogen bonding. Aromatic protons on the para-substituted benzene ring appear as two doublets near ~7.5 ppm and ~7.0 ppm, consistent with the symmetry of the ring and coupling between adjacent protons. A singlet at ~6.5 ppm corresponds to the vinyl proton on the /C=C(/F) group, with its downfield shift caused by the electronegative fluorine atom. The fluorine itself does not appear in the H-NMR spectrum but influences neighboring protons via spin-spin coupling.

The multiplet between 7.5–8.5 ppm integrates to three protons and represents the remaining aromatic protons on the fluorinated ring, split by vicinal coupling and perturbed by the fluorine’s electronegativity. The triplet at ~4 ppm (intensity ~0.025) is assigned to the methylene protons adjacent to the ester oxygen (O-CH2-), which experience deshielding due to the electronegative oxygen. The broad cluster of peaks from 0.9–2.5 ppm corresponds to the aliphatic and cyclohexyl protons. The most intense peak at ~1.3 ppm (intensity ~0.07) arises from the methyl groups of the pentyl chain (C5H11) and the cyclohexane ring’s equatorial/equivalent axial protons. The splitting patterns here reflect complex coupling in the cyclohexane ring and overlapping signals from the pentyl chain’s methylene groups. Notably, the absence of peaks above 13 ppm rules out carboxylic acid protons, consistent with the ester functionality. The fluorine substituents introduce minimal direct splitting in the proton spectrum due to the lack of strong H-F coupling in this structural context. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the distinct electronic environments of aromatic, ester-linked, and aliphatic regions."

    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C7H7BrOS (SMILES: CC(=O)c1cc(Br)c(C)s1). The spectrum displays characteristic vibrational absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups and structural features of the molecule. The most prominent peak, observed near 1700 cm⁻¹, is attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the acetyl group (CC(=O)-), a hallmark of ketones. This strong, sharp absorption confirms the presence of the carbonyl moiety in the molecule. Additional peaks in the 1500–1600 cm⁻¹ region correspond to the aromatic C=C stretching vibrations of the thiophene ring (a five-membered sulfur-containing heterocycle), consistent with the conjugated system in the structure. The spectrum also exhibits distinct absorptions below 1000 cm⁻¹, including a notable band near 800 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of C-S stretching vibrations in thiophene derivatives. The presence of bromine is supported by weaker, broader absorptions in the 500–600 cm⁻¹ range, corresponding to C-Br stretching modes. Peaks in the 2900–3100 cm⁻¹ region arise from C-H stretching vibrations of the methyl group (-C) and aromatic C-H bonds on the thiophene ring. The absence of broad O-H or N-H stretching bands aligns with the molecule’s lack of hydroxyl or amine groups. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains multiple sharp peaks, reflecting the complex vibrational modes of the aromatic ring, substituents, and halogen. These features collectively confirm the molecular structure, with the IR spectrum serving as a diagnostic tool to validate the presence of the acetyl, thiophene, bromine, and methyl functionalities in C7H7BrOS."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C15H22O2S (SMILES: CCCC(O)(CCC)CSc1cccc(C=O)c1). The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, revealing key structural features of the molecule. The spectrum displays distinct cross-peaks corresponding to specific proton-carbon pairs. In the aldehyde region, a prominent cross-peak is observed at approximately 9.8 ppm (¹H) and 190 ppm (¹³C), consistent with the formyl group (C=O) attached to the aromatic ring. This downfield chemical shift for the aldehyde proton and carbon reflects the strong deshielding effect of the carbonyl group. The aromatic region shows multiple cross-peaks between 6.8–7.8 ppm (¹H) and 120–140 ppm (¹³C), corresponding to the protons and carbons of the benzene ring. These shifts are typical for substituted aromatic systems, with slight variations due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the aldehyde and thioether substituents. A distinct cross-peak at ~3.5 ppm (¹H) and 65 ppm (¹³C) indicates a methine proton (CH) attached to a carbon bearing a hydroxyl group (C-OH), consistent with the tertiary alcohol moiety in the molecule. This region is further supported by adjacent aliphatic peaks at ~1.2–1.5 ppm (¹H) and 20–40 ppm (¹³C), representing the protons and carbons of the alkyl chains (CCC and CCC groups) attached to the central carbon. These aliphatic signals exhibit typical upfield shifts due to their saturated nature. The thioether linkage (C-S-C) is indirectly inferred from the absence of peaks in the sulfur-bound carbon region (~30–40 ppm for sp³ carbons), as sulfur typically does not produce strong HSQC correlations unless directly bonded to protons. Overall, the HSQC spectrum confirms the connectivity of the molecule, highlighting the aldehyde, aromatic, alcohol, and aliphatic regions while validating the structural features implied by the molecular formula and SMILES notation. The observed chemical shifts align with expected trends for functional groups in this compound, providing a clear framework for further structural analysis."

The spectrum displays characteristic cross-peaks correlating proton (¹H) and carbon (¹³C) chemical shifts for directly bonded pairs. The ¹H dimension spans approximately 14 to -2 ppm, while the ¹³C dimension ranges from 0 to 200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (¹H 6–8 ppm, ¹³C 100–150 ppm):** Multiple cross-peaks are observed here, consistent with the molecule's three aromatic rings (fluoropyridine, pyrimidine, and pyridine). The fluorine substituent on the pyridine ring (Fc1cnccc1) likely induces deshielding effects, contributing to downfield shifts (higher ppm) for adjacent protons and carbons. The pyrimidine ring (nc2nc1) and the terminal pyridine (c1cccnc1) also contribute to this region, with protonated carbons appearing as distinct cross-peaks. 2. **Aliphatic Region (¹H 3–5 ppm, ¹³C 50–70 ppm):** A cluster of cross-peaks in this range corresponds to the morpholine ring (N3CCOCC3). The CH₂ groups in morpholine typically exhibit moderate shielding, resulting in chemical shifts in this intermediate range. The oxygen atom in the ring further influences the electronic environment, slightly deshielding adjacent carbons. 3. **Low-Field Protons (¹H > 8 ppm):** A few cross-peaks extend into this region, likely from protons on the pyrimidine or pyridine rings experiencing strong deshielding due to electron-withdrawing effects of nitrogen atoms or the fluorine substituent. 4. **Carbon-Rich Region (¹³C 150–200 ppm):** Sparse cross-peaks here may represent quaternary carbons or carbons directly bonded to electronegative atoms (e.g., the fluorine-bearing carbon in the pyridine ring or carbons adjacent to ring nitrogens). The spectrum reflects the molecule's heteroaromatic and aliphatic components, with the fluorine atom subtly modulating chemical shifts through inductive effects. The HSQC data aligns with the expected connectivity of the SMILES structure, confirming the presence of aromatic systems and the morpholine moiety. No unexpected peaks are observed, suggesting a pure sample without significant impurities. This analysis provides insights into the electronic environment of protons and carbons, aiding in structural validation and functional group identification."

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across a chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the structural complexity of the compound. Key features include a cluster of intense peaks between 150–160 ppm, likely corresponding to aromatic or heteroaromatic carbons, such as those in the imidazole ring (C2, C5) and the chlorinated purine-like core (C8, C9). A prominent singlet near 120 ppm may arise from the trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatic carbons (C3'–C5' in the benzene ring), influenced by the electron-withdrawing CF3 group. Additional signals in the 100–130 ppm range suggest sp2-hybridized carbons in conjugated systems, including the imidazole ring (C4, C5) and the purine-like scaffold. The aliphatic region (0–60 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks, including a triplet near 40 ppm (C1'') and a quartet at ~30 ppm (C2''), consistent with the butyl chain (CCCC) attached to the N1 position. A methylene group (C3'') adjacent to the imidazole ring appears as a multiplet around 25 ppm. The carbonyl carbons (C=O) at positions 2 and 6 of the purine-like core resonate at ~165 ppm, appearing as sharp singlets due to their deshielded, sp2-hybridized nature. Notably, the CF3 group itself does not produce a carbon signal in this spectrum, as fluorine decoupling typically suppresses carbon-fluorine couplings. The spectrum’s peak multiplicities and chemical shifts align with the molecular symmetry and electronic environments predicted by the SMILES notation. For instance, the equivalence of the two carbonyl groups (C2=O and C6=O) is reflected in their overlapping signals, while the chlorinated carbon (C8) in the purine core contributes to the downfield shift of adjacent resonances. The absence of peaks above 180 ppm confirms the lack of aldehyde or carboxylic acid functionalities, consistent with the molecular formula. Overall, the C-NMR data corroborates the structural features of the compound, including its heterocyclic rings, aliphatic chains, and halogenated substituents."

A sharp, intense peak near 3500 cm⁻¹ indicates the presence of an O-H stretching vibration, consistent with the hydroxymethyl (-CH₂OH) group in the structure. Adjacent to this, a broad band around 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests N-H stretching from the amide linkage (C=O-NH), though its intensity is reduced due to hydrogen bonding. The strong absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the amide group, a hallmark of the molecule’s amide functionality. In the fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹), multiple sharp peaks are observed, including those near 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1500 cm⁻¹, which are attributed to aromatic C=C stretching vibrations from the polycyclic aromatic system. A distinct band near 1250 cm⁻¹ likely arises from C-N stretching vibrations in the amide and tertiary amine groups. The absence of peaks in the 2100–2200 cm⁻¹ region confirms the lack of alkyne or nitrile groups, aligning with the molecular formula. The spectrum also shows a series of weaker absorptions between 1000–1300 cm⁻¹, which may correspond to C-O stretching from the hydroxymethyl group and in-plane bending vibrations of aromatic C-H bonds.

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 470, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 469 g/mol for C24H18F3N3O4. This peak confirms the intact molecular structure under ionization conditions. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 205 (base peak), 188, 296, 206, and 297, indicating key fragmentation pathways. The base peak at m/z 205 suggests a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the urea linkage (-NH-CO-NH-) and loss of the trifluorophenyl group (C6H3F3). This fragment may retain the quinoline core (C9H6N) and methoxy-substituted aromatic ring, consistent with the observed m/z value. The adjacent peaks at m/z 204 and 206 may represent isotopic contributions from nitrogen (14N/15N) or minor structural variants. The peak at m/z 188 could result from further fragmentation of the quinoline moiety, possibly involving loss of a methoxy group (-OCH3, 31 Da) or hydroxyl radical (-OH, 17 Da) from the parent structure. Peaks at m/z 296 and 297 may correspond to fragments retaining the trifluorophenylurea segment (C6H3F3N2O) linked to parts of the aromatic ether backbone. Smaller peaks at m/z 108 and 109 are likely attributed to low-mass aromatic fragments, such as methoxyphenyl or fluorophenyl ions. The presence of multiple fluorine atoms (F3) influences the fragmentation pattern by stabilizing adjacent positive charges through inductive effects, favoring cleavage near electronegative substituents. The spectrum’s isotopic distribution, particularly for fluorine (19F) and nitrogen, is consistent with the molecular formula, though no significant isotope peaks (e.g., 13C or 15N) are distinctly resolved beyond the base peak. Overall, the mass spectrum provides critical insights into the compound’s structural integrity and fragmentation behavior, highlighting the stability of the quinoline-urea scaffold and the influence of fluorine substitution on decomposition pathways."

The spectrum exhibits a base peak at m/z 223, which corresponds to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the molecular weight of 222 g/mol for C8H3F5N2. The presence of five fluorine atoms contributes to the stability of the molecular ion, as fluorine’s high electronegativity and lack of significant isotopic abundance (¹⁹F is monoisotopic) result in minimal isotope splitting. Key fragment ions are observed at m/z 203, 196, 185, and 153. The peak at m/z 203 (approximately 25% relative abundance) likely arises from the loss of hydrogen fluoride (HF, Δm = 20) from the molecular ion, a common fragmentation pathway for fluorinated compounds. The peak at m/z 196 (10% abundance) may result from the elimination of a cyano group (CN, Δm = 26) or a rearrangement involving the pyridine ring. The fragment at m/z 185 (15% abundance) suggests the loss of a neutral C₂HF₂ moiety (Δm = 38), potentially originating from the trifluoromethyl (CF₃) or difluoromethyl (CF₂) groups. The peak at m/z 153 (20% abundance) is consistent with the cleavage of the CF₃ group (Δm = 69), leaving a C₅H₃F₂N₂⁺ fragment. This fragmentation aligns with the structure’s 2-cyano-5-(perfluoroethyl)pyridine motif, where the electron-withdrawing nitrile and fluorinated substituents destabilize the ring, promoting bond cleavage at the CF₃–CF₂ or CF₂–pyridine junctions. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 150 indicates that further fragmentation of the pyridine ring or nitrile group is limited under the ionization conditions. The spectrum’s simplicity, dominated by the molecular ion and a few high-mass fragments, reflects the stability of the aromatic core and the strong C–F bonds, which resist extensive breakdown. These features are characteristic of highly fluorinated heterocycles, where fluorine’s inductive effects influence fragmentation pathways and enhance molecular ion survival."

Notable peaks at m/z 174 and 203 suggest the presence of chlorine isotopes (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl) and further fragmentation pathways. The m/z 203 peak corresponds to the loss of SO2Cl (99.45 Da) from the molecular ion, leaving a methoxyphenyl-thiophene core.

Key features include: 1. **Carbonyl Region (160–200 ppm):** - A prominent peak near **175 ppm** corresponds to the carboxylic acid carbonyl carbon (C=O), which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing hydroxyl group. - A peak around **165 ppm** is attributed to the amide carbonyl carbon (N–C=O), slightly less deshielded than the carboxylic acid due to resonance stabilization with the adjacent nitrogen. 2. **Aromatic/Pyridine Region (100–160 ppm):** - Multiple peaks between **120–150 ppm** arise from the pyridine ring carbons. The carbon bonded to the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) appears downfield (~145 ppm) due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of CF3.

This C-NMR spectrum provides clear evidence of the compound’s functional groups and carbon connectivity as defined by its SMILES notation."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H11NO2 (SMILES: CC(C(=O)O)C(C#N)c1ccccc1). The spectrum displays four distinct cross-peaks, correlating proton and carbon chemical shifts. The peak at ~10 ppm (¹H) and ~180 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the carboxylic acid carbon and its deshielded proton, though the proton is typically exchangeable and may appear broadened. The aromatic region shows a cluster of peaks around ~7 ppm (¹H) and ~130 ppm (¹³C), consistent with protons and carbons in the benzene ring. A peak at ~3 ppm (¹H) and ~60 ppm (¹³C) indicates a methine proton (CH) adjacent to the nitrile and carboxylic acid groups, where electron-withdrawing effects deshield both nuclei. Finally, the peak at ~2 ppm (¹H) and ~20 ppm (¹³C) arises from the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the central carbon, slightly deshielded by proximity to polar functional groups. These observations align with the structural features of 2-cyano-2-phenylpropanoic acid, where the HSQC highlights key proton-carbon correlations despite the quaternary nature of the central carbon bearing the nitrile and carboxylic acid substituents."

The spectrum displays correlations between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, with the ¹H dimension (x-axis) spanning ~14 to -2 ppm and the ¹³C dimension (y-axis) spanning ~0 to 200 ppm. Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic region (7–8 ppm ¹H, 110–140 ppm ¹³C):** Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to the fluorinated aromatic ring (C1–C6) and the substituted phenyl ring (C1’–C6’). The fluorine substituent at position 4’ causes deshielding of adjacent protons (e.g., H5’), shifting them downfield (~7.8 ppm). The methoxy group (OCH₃) at position 2’ is evident as a singlet at ~3.8 ppm (¹H) and ~55 ppm (¹³C), consistent with its electron-donating effect. 2. **Aliphatic region (0.5–3 ppm ¹H, 10–50 ppm ¹³C):** Peaks in this area correspond to the methyl (CH₃) and methylene (CH₂) groups. The isopropyl moiety (C8–C9) shows correlations near ~1.2 ppm (¹H) and ~20 ppm (¹³C) for the terminal methyl groups, while the central methine (C8-H) appears at ~3.2 ppm (¹H) and ~30 ppm (¹³C). The piperazine ring (N2CCNCC2) contributes peaks near ~2.5–3.5 ppm (¹H) and ~45–55 ppm (¹³C), reflecting its symmetric structure. 3. **Sulfone-adjacent carbons (3–4 ppm ¹H, 50–70 ppm ¹³C):** The sulfone group (SO₂) at position C1’ deshields the adjacent amine-bearing carbon (C2’), producing a cross-peak at ~3.6 ppm (¹H) and ~60 ppm (¹³C). The nitrogen-bound protons (NH₂) are not directly visible in HSQC but may influence nearby carbon shifts. 4. **Downfield ¹³C signals (>100 ppm):** No significant peaks appear in the carbonyl or aldehyde regions (160–200 ppm), confirming the absence of such groups. The highest ¹³C shifts (~130 ppm) correspond to quaternary aromatic carbons (e.g., C4’ adjacent to fluorine). The spectrum’s distribution reflects the molecule’s structural complexity, with distinct clusters for aromatic, aliphatic, and heteroatom-linked environments. The fluorine substituent’s inductive effects and the sulfone’s electron-withdrawing properties are evident in the deshielding of nearby nuclei. This HSQC data provides critical insights into the molecule’s connectivity, aiding in the assignment of proton-carbon pairs and validating the proposed structure."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks corresponding to protons in different chemical environments. A prominent singlet at ~12 ppm (1H) is characteristic of the hydroxymethyl (-CH2OH) proton, likely deshielded due to hydrogen bonding or proximity to electronegative oxygen. A sharp singlet at ~10 ppm (1H) corresponds to the aldehyde proton (-CHO), consistent with its deshielded environment adjacent to the carbonyl group. A singlet at ~6 ppm (1H) may arise from the indole NH proton, though its position suggests partial shielding or solvent effects. The aromatic region (~7–8 ppm) shows overlapping multiplets (total integration ~8H), reflecting protons on the chlorinated indole and phenyl rings. The chlorine substituent likely causes downfield shifts for adjacent aromatic protons. Peaks at ~3 ppm (triplet, 2H) and ~2 ppm (multiplet, 4H) are attributed to the cyclopropane ring protons and the hydroxymethyl -CH2- group. The cyclopropane protons appear slightly deshielded due to ring strain and proximity to the oxygenated side chain. The spectrum confirms the presence of all expected functional groups: aldehyde, hydroxymethyl, indole, chlorinated aryl rings, and cyclopropane. Integration aligns with the molecular formula, accounting for 16 protons (1H aldehyde, 1H OH, 1H NH, 8H aromatic, 2H CH2OH, 3H cyclopropane). No significant impurities or unexpected signals are observed, supporting the structural assignment."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C10H14N6 (SMILES: Cc1cc(C)n(-c2ccc(N(C)N)nn2)n1). The spectrum displays five distinct cross-peaks, indicating correlations between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei. Starting with the most downfield ¹H chemical shifts, two peaks at (11.0 ppm, 120 ppm) and (10.0 ppm, 125 ppm) correspond to aromatic protons on the pyrimidine-like ring (nn2-c2ccc- fragment) attached to the pyrazole moiety. These protons are strongly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effect of adjacent nitrogen atoms in the heterocycle. The corresponding ¹³C shifts (120–125 ppm) are consistent with sp²-hybridized carbons in an electron-deficient aromatic system. A peak at (5.5 ppm, 55 ppm) suggests a methine proton (CH) in a moderately deshielded environment, likely part of the pyrazole ring (n1-c1cc(C)- fragment). This proton experiences shielding from the ring current but is slightly deshielded by the adjacent nitrogen. The ¹³C shift at 55 ppm indicates a sp² carbon adjacent to electronegative heteroatoms. Two upfield peaks at (3.5 ppm, 40 ppm) and (2.5 ppm, 20 ppm) correspond to methyl groups. The (3.5 ppm, 40 ppm) correlation arises from the N-methyl group in the -N(C)N- substituent, where the nitrogen’s inductive effect shifts the proton and carbon signals downfield relative to typical alkyl methyls. The (2.5 ppm, 20 ppm) peak represents the two equivalent methyl groups on the pyrazole ring, which are shielded due to their position on an electron-rich aromatic system. The spectrum lacks peaks for quaternary carbons or exchangeable protons (e.g., -NH- in the N(C)N group), as HSQC selectively detects only ¹H-¹³C pairs. The observed data align with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of two aromatic systems (pyrazole and pyrimidine-like rings), three methyl groups, and a hydrazine-derived substituent. This analysis highlights the utility of HSQC in mapping proton-carbon connectivity in nitrogen-rich heterocycles."

The spectrum displays a prominent molecular ion peak at m/z 287, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, consistent with the calculated molecular weight of 286.3 g/mol. The base peak at m/z 287 indicates high stability of the protonated species under the ionization conditions. Key fragment ions are observed at m/z 267, 244, 217, 177, 159, 147, 107, and 91. The peak at m/z 267 (267 = 287 – 20) suggests loss of HF, a common fragmentation pathway for fluorinated compounds. The m/z 244 (287 – 43) likely arises from cleavage of the propyl chain (C3H7, 43 Da) attached to the oxygen atom. A notable fragment at m/z 217 (287 – 70) may correspond to the loss of a C4H6F group, potentially involving the imidazoline ring (C1=NCCN1) and adjacent carbons. The m/z 177 peak could represent a fragment retaining the trifluoromethylphenol moiety (C8H6F3O+), while m/z 159 (177 – 18) suggests subsequent loss of water. The ion at m/z 147 may derive from the aromatic ring system (C8H7F2N+), with partial retention of fluorine atoms. Lower-mass fragments at m/z 107 and 91 are characteristic of substituted benzyl or tropylium ions, likely originating from the aromatic core (C7H5F2+ and C7H7+, respectively). The spectrum reflects the molecule’s structural features, including the trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) and the imidazoline ring, which influence fragmentation patterns. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 287 confirms the molecular ion assignment. This analysis aligns with the proposed structure, demonstrating predictable cleavages of aliphatic chains and retention of aromatic/fluorinated fragments."

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent features include a high-intensity peak at ~12 ppm, corresponding to the terminal methyl group (CH3) of the propyl chain, and a moderate peak at ~30 ppm attributed to the adjacent methylene (CH2) carbons. In the aromatic region (100–160 ppm), multiple peaks are observed. A sharp, intense peak at ~150 ppm is indicative of a quaternary carbon in the quinoline moiety, likely the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen atom, which experiences strong deshielding. Additional peaks at ~130–140 ppm arise from aromatic carbons in the benzene rings, including those directly bonded to the oxadiazole and quinoline groups. A distinct peak at ~110 ppm corresponds to a carbon in the 1,2,4-oxadiazole ring, likely the carbon bonded to oxygen, which is shielded relative to other aromatic carbons. The spectrum also shows minor peaks in the 150–160 ppm range, reflecting quaternary carbons in the heterocyclic systems. The overall pattern aligns with the molecular structure, where the propyl chain contributes aliphatic signals, while the fused aromatic systems (quinoline, benzene, and oxadiazole) dominate the downfield region. The limited number of peaks compared to the 20-carbon framework suggests symmetry in certain substructures, such as the para-substituted benzene ring, which reduces the number of unique carbon environments. This spectrum provides clear evidence of the molecule’s heterocyclic and aromatic components, with chemical shifts consistent with the electronic effects of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the structure."

The spectrum displays several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups and structural features of the molecule. A prominent sharp peak at ~3300 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of aromatic C-H stretching vibrations, consistent with the multiple aromatic rings in the structure, including the pyridine, pyrrole, pyrimidine, and fluorophenyl moieties. The strong absorption near 1300 cm⁻¹ is attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of the sulfone group (S=O), which is a key feature of the methylsulfonyl substituent. Additional peaks in the 1100–1200 cm⁻¹ region likely correspond to C-F stretching vibrations from the fluorine atoms in the 4-fluorobenzyl and 5-fluoropyrimidine groups. A distinct band at ~800 cm⁻¹ is indicative of C-Cl stretching, aligning with the chloro substituent on the pyrimidine ring. The aromatic C=C stretching vibrations are observed in the 1400–1600 cm⁻¹ range, reflecting the conjugated π-systems of the heterocyclic and phenyl rings. The fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) contains complex overlapping peaks, which may arise from bending vibrations of C-H, C-N, and C-S bonds, as well as out-of-plane deformations of the aromatic systems. Notably, the absence of broad O-H or N-H stretches confirms the lack of hydroxyl or primary/secondary amine groups in the molecule. This IR spectrum provides critical insights into the vibrational modes of the compound, corroborating the presence of sulfone, halogenated aromatic systems, and heterocyclic frameworks as defined by the given molecular structure."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C18H26O2 (SMILES: O=C(O)CCCCCCCCCC=Cc1ccccc1). The HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) spectrum provides direct correlations between ¹H and ¹³C nuclei through one-bond couplings (¹JCH), enabling the assignment of protonated carbons. The observed peaks reveal key structural features of the molecule. In the aliphatic region (¹H δ 0.5–3.0 ppm; ¹³C δ 10–40 ppm), a cluster of peaks corresponds to the long alkyl chain (CH₂)₉ in the structure. These methylene groups exhibit characteristic chemical shifts, with terminal methyl protons appearing near δ 0.8–1.0 ppm (¹³C δ 14 ppm) and internal methylene protons resonating between δ 1.2–1.6 ppm (¹³C δ 22–32 ppm). The HSQC cross-peaks confirm the connectivity of these protons to their respective carbons. A prominent peak near ¹H δ 5.3 ppm and ¹³C δ 130 ppm corresponds to the vinylic proton (CH=) of the C=C double bond in the chain. This signal is consistent with a trans-alkene geometry, as indicated by the chemical shift dispersion. The adjacent sp²-hybridized carbon (¹³C δ 130 ppm) also shows a correlation, though its exact position may overlap with aromatic signals. In the aromatic region (¹H δ 7.0–8.0 ppm; ¹³C δ 120–140 ppm), a group of peaks reflects the substituted benzene ring (c1ccccc1). The aromatic protons appear as multiplets in the ¹H dimension, coupled to their directly bonded aromatic carbons. The ¹³C shifts in this region are typical for phenyl groups, with some signals potentially shifted due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the adjacent alkene. A distinct cross-peak at ¹H δ ~10.5 ppm and ¹³C δ ~180 ppm is observed, consistent with the carboxylic acid proton (COOH) and its carbonyl carbon. This high-field ¹H shift is characteristic of acidic protons involved in hydrogen bonding, while the ¹³C shift aligns with a sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbon. The spectrum lacks signals in the ¹H δ 3.0–5.0 ppm range, confirming the absence of oxygenated protons (e.g., alcohols, amines) or heavily substituted carbons. Overall, the HSQC data aligns with the proposed structure, validating the connectivity of the carboxylic acid, alkyl chain, alkene, and aromatic ring. This analysis underscores the utility of HSQC in resolving complex molecular frameworks by mapping proton-carbon pairs."

The most downfield cross-peak appears at approximately 10.2 ppm (¹H) and 190 ppm (¹³C), characteristic of an aldehyde proton and its associated carbonyl carbon. This feature aligns with the C=O group in the naphthaldehyde moiety of the structure. A second prominent peak at 8.0 ppm (¹H) and 135 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to an aromatic proton and its attached carbon, likely from the electron-deficient aromatic ring adjacent to the sulfonate group. A third cross-peak at 7.8 ppm (¹H) and 130 ppm (¹³C) reflects another aromatic proton-carbon pair, consistent with the extended conjugation of the naphthalene system. The fourth major peak at 5.2 ppm (¹H) and 65 ppm (¹³C) indicates a methylene group (CH₂) bonded to an oxygen atom, matching the OCH₂ linker in the methanesulfonate ester. Additionally, a weaker correlation at 2.5 ppm (¹H) and 50 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the methyl group (CH₃) of the sulfonate ester, with the ¹³C shift reflecting its attachment to the electron-withdrawing sulfur atom.

The spectrum displays distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the diverse carbon environments in the molecule. The most prominent resonance occurs near 170 ppm, corresponding to the carbonyl carbon of the ethyl ester group (C=O), which is characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons in carboxylic acid derivatives. A sharp peak near 150 ppm is attributed to the fluorinated alkene carbon (C-F) in the α,β-unsaturated ester moiety, where deshielding by the electronegative fluorine atom elevates the chemical shift. Several peaks in the 120–140 ppm range arise from aromatic carbons in the pyridine ring, with the chlorine substituent causing downfield shifts for adjacent carbons. The tert-butyl group of the Boc-protected piperidine ring produces a signal near 28 ppm, typical for sp³-hybridized quaternary carbons. The ethyl ester’s CH₂ group appears as a triplet near 60 ppm due to coupling with adjacent protons, while the piperidine ring’s methylene carbons resonate between 20–50 ppm, reflecting their aliphatic nature. Notably, the absence of peaks above 180 ppm confirms no additional carbonyl groups beyond the ester, and the lack of signals below 10 ppm excludes methyl groups directly bonded to electronegative atoms.

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across a broad chemical shift range (0–200 ppm), reflecting the diverse electronic environments of the 20 carbon atoms in the structure. Key features include: 1. **High-field region (0–50 ppm):** A prominent peak near 20 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (C-CH3) attached to the thiazole ring. Additional peaks in this region (e.g., ~30–40 ppm) arise from the aliphatic carbons of the piperidine ring ([C@H]3CCCNC3), which exhibit moderate shielding due to their saturated nature. 2. **Aromatic/olefinic region (100–160 ppm):** Multiple intense peaks are observed here, consistent with the aromatic systems in the molecule. The carbonyl carbon of the amide group (C(=O)NH2) appears as a sharp resonance near 160 ppm, characteristic of sp²-hybridized carbonyl carbons. Peaks between 120–140 ppm correspond to the trifluoromethyl-substituted benzene ring (c3ccc(C(F)(F)F)cc3) and the pyrimidine ring (ncnc), with deshielding effects from electronegative nitrogen and fluorine atoms. The thiazole ring (sc2ncnc) contributes additional peaks in this range due to its conjugated heteroaromatic system. 3. **Low-field region (160–200 ppm):** A distinct peak near 170 ppm may correspond to a carbon adjacent to the thiazole sulfur (C-S), though such shifts are less common and could also indicate minor impurities or overlapping signals. The spectrum’s resolution and peak distribution align with the molecular complexity, showing no significant overlap except in crowded aromatic regions. The absence of broad peaks suggests minimal conformational flexibility in the solid-state or solution environment. Fluorine-induced splitting (e.g., from CF3 groups) is not explicitly resolved here, likely due to the low natural abundance of ¹³C and the dominance of direct carbon shielding effects. Overall, the chemical shifts and intensities corroborate the proposed structure, highlighting the molecule’s heterocyclic cores, amide functionality, and fluorinated aromatic substituent."

The observed fragmentation pattern aligns with the proposed structure, where the amide bond, aromatic rings, and heterocyclic components contribute to the characteristic mass losses. The spectrum’s isotopic signatures and peak distribution provide critical insights into the compound’s structural features, including the presence of chlorine substituents and the stability of key fragments under ionization conditions. This analysis underscores the utility of mass spectrometry in confirming molecular identity and elucidating decomposition pathways for complex organic molecules."

    "text": "This is a HSQC spectrum of a molecule with formula C25H26N2O2 (SMILES: CCCCc1cc(C(C)C(=O)O)cn1Cc1ccc(-c2ccccc2C#N)cc1). The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating directly bonded 1H and 13C nuclei, providing insights into the molecular structure. The 1H chemical shift axis (x-axis) spans 14 to -2 ppm, while the 13C axis (y-axis) ranges from 0 to 200 ppm. Key features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (6-8 ppm, 100-160 ppm):** A cluster of cross-peaks in the 6.5-8 ppm (1H) and 110-140 ppm (13C) range corresponds to the aromatic protons and carbons of the phenyl and pyrrole rings. The pyrrole ring (cyclic amine) typically exhibits deshielded protons in this region, while the biphenyl system contributes to the dense pattern. The nitrile-substituted phenyl ring likely shows distinct correlations due to electron-withdrawing effects, shifting some carbons downfield (e.g., ~130-140 ppm). 2. **Aliphatic Region (0-3 ppm, 10-40 ppm):** Peaks in the 0.8-1.5 ppm (1H) and 10-30 ppm (13C) range arise from the butyl chain (CCCC) and the methyl group (CH3) adjacent to the carboxylic acid. The terminal methyl of the butyl chain appears as a triplet near 0.8 ppm, correlated with a carbon at ~14 ppm. The methylene groups (CH2) of the butyl chain show up at ~1.2-1.5 ppm (1H) and ~22-30 ppm (13C). 3. **Carboxylic Acid and Nitrile Features:** The carboxylic acid proton (COOH) is typically observed as a broad singlet in the 10-12 ppm range, but its correlation may be weak or absent due to rapid exchange. The nitrile carbon (C#N) appears as a sharp peak near ~115-120 ppm in the 13C dimension, though its directly attached proton (none, as it’s a quaternary carbon) does not produce a cross-peak in HSQC. 4. **Quaternary Carbons:** Quaternary carbons (e.g., the ipso carbon of the nitrile-substituted phenyl ring or the carboxylic acid carbon) lack directly bonded protons and thus do not generate cross-peaks in HSQC, appearing as gaps in the spectrum. The HSQC data aligns with the structural features of the molecule, confirming the presence of aromatic systems, aliphatic chains, and functional groups like nitrile and carboxylic acid. The absence of certain correlations (e.g., quaternary carbons) and the dispersion of cross-peaks across the spectrum reflect the molecule’s complexity and the diverse electronic environments of its atoms."

The base peak (100% relative abundance) appears at m/z 175, indicating a highly stable fragment ion likely derived from cleavage of the side chain. Key fragment ions at m/z 106, 108, and 118 suggest the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic substructures, consistent with the quinoline-like core (oc(=O)ccc2cc1OCCC) in the SMILES notation. Peaks at m/z 120 and 132 may arise from rearrangement or loss of small neutral fragments (e.g., CO or H2O) from the parent ion. Additional significant fragments at m/z 161, 176, and 189 indicate stepwise degradation of the ethylphenoxy and piperazinyl groups. The cluster of peaks around m/z 203–248 (203, 219, 233, 247, 248) suggests complex fragmentation involving the N-phenylpiperazine moiety, with possible cleavage of the C-N bond or loss of the phenyl group. A minor peak at m/z 290 may represent a fragment retaining the quinoline core with partial side-chain retention. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 409 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity, while the distribution of lower-mass fragments aligns with the structural complexity of the molecule. These observations collectively support the assigned molecular formula and structural features encoded in the SMILES string."

The peak at m/z 247 (35% abundance) likely arises from homolytic cleavage of the ester linkage, generating a fragment retaining the indazole-morpholine moiety. The m/z 229 (20% abundance) peak may correspond to further loss of a C2H4O unit from the morpholine ring. Fragments at m/z 145–147 (10–15% abundance) suggest scission of the indazole ring system, possibly forming a benzotriazole-derived ion. The m/z 163 (12% abundance) peak could result from cleavage of the N-N bond in the indazole ring, yielding a substituted pyrazole fragment. The low-abundance peak at m/z 85 (5% abundance) may represent a morpholinium ion (C4H8NO+), a common fragment for morpholine-containing compounds. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 331 confirms the molecular ion assignment, while the distribution of fragment ions aligns with the structural features of the ester-linked indazole-morpholine hybrid.

The spectrum displays characteristic peaks corresponding to the proton environments in this complex heterocyclic structure. The most downfield signal at ~12 ppm (singlet) is consistent with the sulfonamide (S(=O)₂NH) proton, which is highly deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group. A secondary acidic proton at ~10 ppm (singlet) likely corresponds to the indole [nH] group, which is also deshielded by aromatic conjugation. In the aromatic region (6–9 ppm), multiple peaks reflect the protons on the pyridine ring (c2ncccc2) and the para-substituted benzene ring (COc1ccc(...)cc1). The pyridine protons typically appear as multiplets between 7–9 ppm, while the benzene ring, substituted with electron-donating methoxy and sulfonamide groups, exhibits two doublets (~7.5 ppm and ~7.0 ppm) due to para coupling. A prominent singlet at ~4 ppm (2H) corresponds to the methylene (CH₂) bridge connecting the pyridine and indole moieties (Cc2c(C)[nH]c3...). This group is deshielded by proximity to both aromatic systems. The methoxy group (COCH₃) appears as a singlet near ~3.8 ppm (3H), typical for alkoxy methyl protons. The upfield region (0–3 ppm) reveals key aliphatic features. A sharp singlet at ~2 ppm (2H) likely arises from the CH₂ group adjacent to the carbonyl (C(=O)CH₂C(C)(C)C3), deshielded by the electron-withdrawing ketone. The tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)) produces a high-intensity singlet at ~1.3 ppm (9H), characteristic of three equivalent methyl groups in a sterically hindered environment. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, with distinct peaks for aromatic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic protons. The integration and splitting patterns (though not explicitly shown here) would further confirm the 24-proton count and molecular symmetry. This analysis underscores the utility of H-NMR in resolving complex organic architectures through chemical shift and coupling relationships."

The spectrum displays distinct chemical shifts across the 0–200 ppm range, reflecting the molecule's diverse carbon environments. A prominent peak near 0 ppm corresponds to the tert-butyl group's three equivalent methyl carbons (C(C)(C)C), which are highly shielded due to their aliphatic nature. Adjacent to this, a peak around 14 ppm is attributed to the ethoxy group's terminal methyl carbon (CCO), while the adjacent methylene carbon (CH2) appears near 60 ppm, shifted downfield by the electronegative oxygen atom. In the 100–150 ppm region, multiple peaks arise from aromatic and heteroaromatic carbons. The fluorinated benzene ring (c4cc(F)ccc34) contributes to signals between 110–130 ppm, with fluorine's electron-withdrawing effect deshielding adjacent carbons. The furan ring (c3coc4) introduces peaks near 100–120 ppm, typical for oxygenated heterocycles. The indole-like bicyclic system (n1c2cccc3...) exhibits overlapping aromatic signals in this range, reflecting its conjugated π-system. A sharp, high-intensity peak near 150 ppm corresponds to the ester carbonyl carbons (C=O), which are strongly deshielded due to resonance and inductive effects from the oxygen atoms. Additional minor peaks between 50–100 ppm may arise from the methylene linker (OCc3) and the naphthalene-like bridgehead carbons. The spectrum's complexity reflects the molecule's multifunctional architecture, with clear differentiation between aliphatic, aromatic, and carbonyl environments. These observations align with the proposed structure, confirming the presence of ester, ether, fluorinated aromatic, and heterocyclic moieties."

The spectrum exhibits a molecular ion peak at m/z 470, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 469 g/mol. The base peak at m/z 141 indicates the most abundant fragment ion, likely resulting from cleavage of the ether linkage (C–O bond) between the fluorinated benzyl group and the thiourea moiety, yielding a stable fluorinated benzyl cation. Additional prominent peaks at m/z 283 and 300 suggest fragmentation retaining the thiophene core (nsc) and adjacent functional groups, possibly involving loss of the isopropylamine side chain or carbamate (OCONH) cleavage. The peak at m/z 428 may arise from the loss of a small neutral molecule, such as water (H2O, 18 Da) or ammonia (NH3, 17 Da), from the molecular ion, while the peak at m/z 453 could correspond to the loss of a methylamine (CH3NH2, 31 Da) or similar fragment. Smaller peaks at m/z 84, 101, and 128 are consistent with aliphatic chain fragments, including the isopropyl group (C3H7, 43 Da) and pentyl chain (C5H11, 71 Da) fragments. The presence of fluorine atoms is reflected in the absence of significant isotope peaks, as fluorine-19 is monoisotopic. Notably, the spectrum shows a peak at m/z 240, which may correspond to the thiourea fragment (NCSNH) combined with part of the aromatic system. Peaks at m/z 159 and 184 could represent retained heterocyclic structures with partial side-chain retention. The overall fragmentation pattern suggests facile cleavage of the ether and carbamate bonds, with the fluorinated aromatic ring contributing to the stability of the base peak. This spectrum provides critical insights into the structural features of the molecule, including the connectivity of the fluorinated benzyl ether, thiourea, and aliphatic amine components."

The spectrum displays heteronuclear correlations between directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing insights into the molecule’s structural features. Key observations include: 1. **Alkyne Region**: A distinct peak at ~3 ppm (¹H) and ~75 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the terminal alkyne proton and its attached carbon. This is consistent with the C#C group in the SMILES notation, where the protonated alkyne carbon exhibits characteristic deshielding due to sp-hybridization. 2. **Aromatic System**: Multiple cross-peaks in the 6.5–8 ppm (¹H) and 110–140 ppm (¹³C) regions arise from aromatic protons and their directly bonded carbons. These signals align with the two benzene rings in the structure, with substituents (ester and ether groups) causing slight chemical shift variations. 3. **Ester-Linked Methylene and Methyl Groups**: A correlation at ~4 ppm (¹H) and ~60 ppm (¹³C) reflects the OCH₂ group of the ethyl ester (–COOCH₂CH₃), while a peak at ~1.2 ppm (¹H) and ~14 ppm (¹³C) corresponds to the terminal methyl (CH₃) of the same ester. 4. **tert-Butyl Groups**: Peaks at ~1.3–1.5 ppm (¹H) and ~25–30 ppm (¹³C) indicate protons attached to methyl groups in the two tert-butyl moieties (OC(C)(C)CC(C)(C)). These shielded signals are typical of highly branched aliphatic environments. 5. **Methylene Bridge**: A correlation near ~1.8 ppm (¹H) and ~35 ppm (¹³C) suggests a CH₂ group in the central bicyclic framework (e.g., the –CC(C)(C)– segment), where moderate deshielding occurs due to adjacent oxygen or alkyl substituents. The spectrum lacks signals for quaternary carbons (e.g., carbonyl carbons of esters, alkyne carbon bonded to the aromatic ring), as expected for HSQC, which only detects ¹H–¹³C pairs. Overall, the observed correlations confirm the presence of alkyne, aromatic, ester, and tert-butyl functionalities, aligning with the proposed structure.

A prominent singlet at 2.5 ppm corresponds to the methyl group (CH₃) attached to the aromatic ring, which is shielded due to its aliphatic nature. In the aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm), two doublets at approximately 7.8 ppm and 8.2 ppm are observed, each integrating to one proton. These signals arise from the two aromatic protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing nitro group ([N+](=O)[O-]) and hydroxyl (OH) substituents, which deshield the protons and shift their resonances downfield. A broad singlet at 10.5 ppm is attributed to the hydroxyl proton, which is highly deshielded due to hydrogen bonding and the electron-withdrawing effects of the adjacent nitro group. Additionally, a minor peak at 13.5 ppm may represent an impurity or solvent artifact, as it does not correspond to any protons in the target molecule. The absence of signals in the 3–4 ppm range suggests no aliphatic protons beyond the methyl group are present. The sulfonate ester group (OSO₂Me) contributes to the electron-withdrawing character of the substituents, further influencing the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons.

Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 187, 218, 244, 262, and 306, with moderate-intensity signals at m/z 105, 112, 119, 124, 157, and 188. The absence of a detectable molecular ion peak (calculated molecular weight: 305.27 g/mol) suggests extensive fragmentation under the ionization conditions, typical of electron ionization (EI) or similar hard ionization techniques. The base peak at m/z 136 likely corresponds to a stable phosphorus-containing fragment, potentially arising from cleavage of the P-O-C bonds in the phosphonate group (P(=O)(OCCO)OCCO), retaining the aromatic ring and part of the side chain. The peak at m/z 187 may represent a fragment retaining the entire phosphonate moiety (CPO3H4) coupled with part of the aromatic system. Peaks at higher m/z values (218, 244, 262, 306) suggest partial retention of the parent structure, possibly through sequential loss of ethylene glycol units (OCCO, 44 Da) or methoxy groups (OCH3, 31 Da). For instance, the m/z 262 peak could correspond to the loss of one OCCO group (44 Da) from the molecular ion, while the m/z 244 peak may involve further dehydration or rearrangement. The lower-m/z peaks (105, 112, 119, 124) likely originate from the aromatic ring system, with m/z 105 potentially representing a substituted benzyl cation (C7H7O+), and m/z 124 possibly indicating a fragment retaining the amino group (NH2) and methoxy-substituted aromatic ring. The peak at m/z 157 may arise from cleavage of the P-C bond, retaining the phosphonate group and a portion of the ethylene glycol chain. The fragmentation pattern reflects the molecule’s structural features, including the phosphonate ester groups and the aromatic amine. The dominance of phosphorus-containing fragments aligns with the high stability of P=O bonds and the propensity of phosphonate esters to undergo heterolytic cleavage. This spectrum provides insights into the compound’s structural motifs, particularly the lability of the ethylene glycol side chains and the resilience of the phosphonate-aromatic core under ionization."

These signals reflect the deshielded protons and carbons in the conjugated system, with slight splitting due to substituent effects from the adjacent quaternary carbon bearing the NH₂ group. 2. **Aliphatic region (¹H: 1.5–2.5 ppm; ¹³C: 25–40 ppm):** Multiple peaks arise from the cyclohexanone ring. The α-CH₂ groups adjacent to the carbonyl (C=O) appear at ~2.3 ppm (¹H) and ~35 ppm (¹³C), reflecting deshielding by the electronegative oxygen. Other CH₂ groups in the ring exhibit upfield shifts (~1.5–2.0 ppm in ¹H, ~25–30 ppm in ¹³C), consistent with their saturated, non-conjugated environment. 3. **Unexpected feature:** A prominent cross-peak at ~10 ppm (¹H) and ~150 ppm (¹³C) suggests a proton attached to a highly deshielded carbon. This could indicate an impurity, solvent artifact, or minor tautomeric form, as the target molecule lacks a functional group typically associated with such shifts (e.g., aldehyde or strongly hydrogen-bonded OH). The absence of signals in the carbonyl region (~210 ppm, ¹³C) aligns with the ketone carbon being quaternary (no directly bonded protons).

The x-axis represents 1H chemical shifts (0–14 ppm), while the y-axis corresponds to 13C chemical shifts (0–200 ppm). Key spectral features include: 1. **Aromatic Region (1H: 6–8 ppm; 13C: 100–160 ppm)**: - Multiple cross-peaks in this region correspond to aromatic protons and their attached carbons. The chlorophenyl group (Nc3cccc(Cl)c3) contributes to signals near 7.2–7.8 ppm (1H) and 120–140 ppm (13C), reflecting deshielding by the electronegative chlorine substituent. Additional aromatic signals arise from the fused heterocyclic core (c1c[n](C)c2...), with protons near 7.5–8.5 ppm and carbons at ~130–150 ppm, indicative of the electron-deficient pyridine-like nitrogen environment. 2. **Aliphatic Region (1H: 2–4 ppm; 13C: 20–60 ppm)**: - Peaks in this range are attributed to the morpholine ring (N3CCOCC3) and methyl groups. The morpholine CH2 groups appear as distinct cross-peaks near 3.4–3.8 ppm (1H) and 50–60 ppm (13C), consistent with their proximity to oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The methyl group attached to the heterocycle (Cc1cn(C)c2...) is observed at ~2.2 ppm (1H) and ~15 ppm (13C), while the N-methyl group (n(C)) appears slightly upfield at ~2.8 ppm (1H) and ~35 ppm (13C), reflecting its electronic environment. 3. **Amide Carbonyl Adjacent Region (1H: 8–10 ppm; 13C: 160–180 ppm)**: - A cross-peak near 8.5 ppm (1H) and 165 ppm (13C) likely corresponds to the proton on the carbon adjacent to the amide carbonyl (C(=O)N3CCOCC3). This downfield shift reflects deshielding by the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group. 4. **Quaternary Carbon Absence**: - No cross-peaks are observed for quaternary carbons (e.g., the carbonyl carbon or aromatic carbons bonded to chlorine), as HSQC only detects protonated carbons. The spectrum’s dispersion of peaks across distinct chemical shift ranges aligns with the molecule’s structural complexity, including aromatic, heteroaromatic, and aliphatic moieties. These correlations confirm the connectivity of protonated carbons and aid in assigning specific functional groups to the molecular framework."

Peaks at m/z 153 and 141 suggest sequential losses of small neutral fragments (e.g., CO or CS), while m/z 129 and 123 correspond to aromatic ring-derived ions. The peak at m/z 91 (tropylium ion) and m/z 77 (phenyl ion) confirm the presence of aromatic systems. Lower-mass fragments (m/z 65, 51, 39) are characteristic of sulfur-containing heterocycles and hydrocarbon chains. The overall fragmentation pattern aligns with the proposed structure, demonstrating the stability of the benzothiophene-oxo framework and the reactivity of the carboxylic acid group under mass spectrometric conditions."

    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C11H15N3O3 (SMILES: COC(=O)c1cnc(NC(=O)C(C)(C)C)cn1). The spectrum displays several key features consistent with the structural motifs in this compound. A broad, moderately intense absorption near 3300 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the N–H stretching vibration of the amide group (NC(=O)C(CH₃)₃), a hallmark of secondary amides. Sharp, intense peaks at ~1700 cm⁻¹ and ~1650 cm⁻¹ are attributed to the carbonyl (C=O) stretches of the ester (COC(=O)) and amide functionalities, respectively, with the ester carbonyl typically appearing at slightly higher wavenumbers due to its electron-withdrawing nature. Additional C–H stretching vibrations from the tert-butyl group (C(CH₃)₃) and methoxy (OCH₃) substituents are evident in the 2850–2960 cm⁻¹ region, showing characteristic symmetric and asymmetric stretches of methyl groups. The aromatic C–H bending modes of the pyrazine ring (c1cnc...cn1) contribute to weaker absorptions near 1450–1600 cm⁻¹, overlapping with C=N stretches of the heteroaromatic system. A distinct peak at ~1050 cm⁻¹ likely arises from the C–O stretching vibration of the ester linkage. The absence of broad O–H stretches (2500–3300 cm⁻¹) confirms the lack of free carboxylic acid or hydroxyl groups, while the lack of sharp nitrile (C≡N) or alkyne (C≡C) peaks near 2200–2300 cm⁻¹ aligns with the absence of such groups in the structure. The spectrum’s fingerprint region (<1500 cm⁻¹) exhibits complex, overlapping bands from C–C, C–N, and C–O bending modes, further supporting the molecular framework. Overall, the spectral features correlate well with the functional groups present in the given SMILES notation, including the pyrazine ring, ester, amide, and tert-butyl substituents."

    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C12H16O3 (SMILES: COc1ccc(C2(O)CCOCC2)cc1). The spectrum displays several characteristic absorption bands corresponding to the functional groups in the molecule. A broad, strong peak centered near 3300 cm⁻¹ is indicative of O-H stretching vibrations, consistent with the hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the cyclohexane ring in the structure. Sharp, intense peaks in the 2850–3000 cm⁻¹ range arise from C-H stretching vibrations in the aliphatic (CH₂ and CH₃) and aromatic (C-H) regions. The methoxy group (-OCH₃) contributes to the C-H stretching signals near 2930 cm⁻¹, while the aromatic ring's C-H stretches appear slightly higher in frequency (3030–3100 cm⁻¹). A prominent absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ is absent, confirming the lack of a carbonyl (C=O) group in the molecule, which aligns with the provided SMILES notation. Instead, the spectrum shows strong peaks in the 1000–1300 cm⁻¹ region, characteristic of C-O stretching vibrations. The ether linkage (C-O-C) in the tetrahydro-2H-pyran ring and the methoxy group both contribute to these absorptions, with the most intense peak near 1100 cm⁻¹ likely representing the asymmetric stretching of the ether oxygen. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains complex, overlapping bands from C-C stretching and bending vibrations in the aromatic ring and aliphatic chain. Peaks near 1200 cm⁻¹ and 1050 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C-O stretching coupled with ring deformations. The aromatic ring also produces out-of-plane C-H bending vibrations in the 700–900 cm⁻¹ range, which are visible as weaker absorptions. Overall, the IR spectrum aligns with the proposed structure, highlighting the hydroxyl, ether, and aromatic functionalities while excluding carbonyl or other unsaturated groups. The absence of sharp peaks near 1700 cm⁻¹ and the presence of strong C-O stretches further validate the molecular formula and connectivity described by the SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays a molecular ion peak at m/z 487, corresponding to the intact molecule [M]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 486.58 g/mol for C28H26N2O4S. The base peak at m/z 298 (100% relative abundance) suggests a highly stable fragment ion, likely resulting from cleavage of the sulfonamide (S-N) bond and loss of the sulfonylphenyl group (C6H5SO2, 141 Da). A prominent peak at m/z 190 indicates a smaller fragment, potentially arising from further decomposition of the indole or amide-containing portion of the molecule. Additional significant peaks at m/z 117, 131, 141, 158, 173, and 331 correspond to aromatic ring fragments and heterocyclic moieties, consistent with the structural features of the indole core (C8H6N) and benzofuran system (C9H7O). The peak at m/z 331 may represent a fragment retaining the sulfonyl group attached to a partially intact indole-benzofuran scaffold. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 487 confirms the molecular ion is the highest mass species detected. The fragmentation pattern reflects the stability of aromatic systems and the susceptibility of sulfonamide and amide bonds to cleavage under ionization conditions, typical of electrospray ionization (ESI) or electron impact (EI) mass spectrometry. This spectrum provides critical insights into the structural integrity and decomposition pathways of the compound, supporting its identification and characterization."

The spectrum displays seven distinct peaks across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, corresponding to the unique carbon environments in the molecule. The most downfield peak at ~170 ppm is attributed to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the ethyl ester group, which typically resonates in this region due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the oxygen atom. Adjacent to this, the aromatic carbons of the pyrazole ring (n[nH]1) appear as two peaks at ~150 ppm and ~120 ppm, reflecting the deshielding effects of the nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring. In the aliphatic region, the ethyl ester’s methylene group (-OCH2-) is observed at ~60 ppm, while its terminal methyl group (-CH3) resonates at ~14 ppm. The butyl chain (CCCC) attached to the pyrazole ring exhibits three distinct signals: the methylene carbon directly bonded to the ring (~30 ppm), followed by two additional methylene groups (~20 ppm and ~10 ppm), and the terminal methyl group (~10 ppm). The overlap of the butyl chain’s terminal methyl and the ethyl ester’s methyl group results in a single peak at ~10 ppm. The spectrum’s peak distribution aligns with the molecular structure, confirming the presence of the ester, pyrazole ring, and butyl substituent. The absence of additional peaks suggests no significant impurities or unexpected structural features.

A prominent singlet at approximately 10 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton (O=C(O)H), a hallmark of acidic protons in H-NMR due to strong deshielding from the electronegative oxygen atoms. The aromatic region (6.5–8.5 ppm) displays a complex multiplet pattern, reflecting the presence of 13 aromatic protons across three benzene rings. The central benzene ring, substituted at positions 1 (carboxylic acid), 2 (benzyloxy), and 3 (benzyloxy), generates a non-symmetric environment, leading to overlapping signals from its three remaining aromatic protons. The two benzyloxy groups (–OCH2Ph) contribute two equivalent sets of five aromatic protons each, further complicating the multiplet structure in this region. A distinct singlet near 5 ppm is observed, assigned to the four methylene protons (–OCH2–) of the two benzyloxy groups.

The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across a range of chemical shifts, reflecting the structural complexity of the molecule. The most prominent peak, observed at approximately -20 ppm, corresponds to the tert-butyl group of the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group, a characteristic feature of aliphatic carbons in such moieties. Adjacent to this, a cluster of peaks between 20–40 ppm arises from the aliphatic methylene (CH2) groups in the piperidine ring and the sulfonamide-bearing ethylene chain, which exhibit moderate shielding due to their saturated environments. A notable resonance near 50 ppm is attributed to the carbon adjacent to the sulfonamide nitrogen (N-CH2), where deshielding by the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl group shifts the signal downfield. The aromatic region (100–160 ppm) contains multiple peaks, including a distinct signal around 120 ppm for the fluorinated aromatic carbon (C-F), which experiences strong deshielding due to the electronegativity of fluorine. Additional aromatic carbons from the benzene ring and the conjugated alkene in the C3=CCN fragment contribute to the multiplet pattern in this region. A sharp peak near 155 ppm corresponds to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) of the Boc group, a hallmark of its high deshielding in C-NMR. The oxygenated methylene carbon (O-CH2) linking the Boc group to the piperidine ring appears around 65 ppm, reflecting intermediate shielding from the adjacent oxygen atom. The sulfonamide methyl group (S-CH3) is observed near 40 ppm, consistent with its partial deshielding by the sulfonyl moiety. The spectrum’s intensity variations correlate with the number of equivalent carbons: the tert-butyl peak is the most intense due to its three equivalent methyl groups, while the carbonyl and aromatic carbons exhibit lower intensities, reflecting their singular environments. Overall, the chemical shifts and peak assignments align with the structural features of the molecule, including the Boc-protected amine, sulfonamide, fluorinated aromatic ring, and aliphatic/alkene components. This analysis underscores the utility of C-NMR in resolving the electronic and steric environments of distinct carbon atoms within complex organic frameworks."

Additional peaks in this region reflect methylene and methine carbons of the fused cyclohexane/cyclopentane rings. A cluster of resonances near 50–60 ppm suggests the presence of oxygenated carbons, likely from the methoxy group (OCH3) attached to the acetal functionality. The acetal carbon itself (OCH2O) typically resonates around 90–100 ppm, aligning with the smaller peaks observed in this range. The absence of signals above 100 ppm confirms no aromatic or unsaturated carbons are present, consistent with the fully saturated hydrocarbon framework. The spectrum’s complexity—approximately 10–15 distinct peaks—reflects the molecule’s stereochemical intricacy, including quaternary carbons at ring junctions (e.g., C10, C13, C14) and the acetal-bearing carbon. The lack of symmetry in the structure amplifies the number of unique carbon environments. Notably, the acetoxy group (OCOCH3) contributes a carbonyl carbon signal near 170 ppm, though its intensity may be diminished due to lower natural abundance or relaxation effects. Overall, the C-NMR data corroborate the proposed steroidal architecture with functional groups at specific loci, providing insights into the molecule’s three-dimensional arrangement and electronic environment."

This fragmentation aligns with the presence of the electron-rich aromatic ring, which facilitates cleavage of the methoxy substituent. The spectrum’s pattern reflects the combined influence of the electron-donating methoxy and amino groups, which stabilize carbocation intermediates during fragmentation, and the electron-withdrawing sulfonyl fluoride group, which directs bond cleavage. The absence of significant peaks below m/z 90 suggests limited aliphatic chain fragmentation, consistent with the molecule’s rigid aromatic structure. Overall, the mass spectral features corroborate the proposed structure, highlighting diagnostic fragments that align with the functional groups in COc1ccc(S(=O)(=O)F)cc1N."

    "text": "This is a C-NMR spectrum of a molecule with formula C18H20ClF2N7 (SMILES: CC(C)(C)c1nc(N2CCC(F)(F)C2)c2nn(Cc3ncccc3Cl)nc2n1). The spectrum displays distinct carbon resonances across the chemical shift range of 0–200 ppm, reflecting the structural complexity of the molecule. The most prominent peak appears near 0 ppm, corresponding to the central quaternary carbon of the tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)), which is shielded due to its aliphatic nature and lack of electronegative substituents. Adjacent to this, a peak at ~25 ppm arises from the three equivalent methyl carbons of the tert-butyl group, which experience moderate shielding in the aliphatic region. A cluster of peaks between 40–60 ppm is observed, likely originating from the carbons in the N-alkyl chain (N2CCC(F)(F)C2). The two carbons adjacent to the fluorine atoms (CF2 group) appear at ~50 ppm, deshielded due to the electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine. The remaining carbon in this ring, bonded to the nitrogen, resonates near 40 ppm, consistent with its position in a saturated heterocycle. The aromatic region (100–160 ppm) exhibits multiple peaks, reflecting the heteroaromatic systems in the molecule. The pyridine ring (ncccc3Cl) contributes resonances between 120–150 ppm, with the carbon adjacent to the chlorine substituent (C3 position) appearing at the highest field (~130 ppm) due to inductive effects. The triazole ring (nn...nc2n1) and its fused pyrimidine-like structure generate peaks in the 140–160 ppm range, corresponding to the electron-deficient aromatic carbons bonded to nitrogen atoms. A sharp, high-intensity peak near 180 ppm is notable, likely representing a quaternary carbon in a highly conjugated environment, such as the carbon at the 2-position of the pyrimidine-like ring (c1nc...n1), which is deshielded by adjacent nitrogen atoms and π-electron withdrawal. Overall, the spectrum aligns with the molecular structure, showcasing distinct chemical environments for aliphatic, heteroaliphatic, and aromatic carbons, with fluorine and nitrogen substituents significantly influencing chemical shifts. The absence of broad peaks or overlapping signals suggests a well-resolved spectrum, typical of small, rigid heterocyclic molecules."

    "text": "This is a MASS spectrum of a molecule with formula C24H19F2NO (SMILES: Fc1cc2ccc(CCc3ccc(OCc4ccccc4)cc3)nc2cc1F). The spectrum exhibits a dominant molecular ion peak at m/z 376, corresponding to the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+, which aligns with the calculated molecular weight of 375 g/mol for C24H19F2NO. This peak serves as the base peak, indicating high stability of the molecular ion under the ionization conditions. Key fragment ions are observed at m/z 286, 285, 179, 180, 192, 193, 106, and 107. The peak at m/z 286 likely arises from the loss of a neutral fragment of 90 Da, possibly corresponding to a benzyl group (C7H6) via cleavage of the ether linkage (O–CH2–Ph), leaving behind a stabilized carbocation. The adjacent peak at m/z 285 may represent a secondary fragmentation product of this intermediate. The cluster of peaks at m/z 179, 180, 192, and 193 suggests structural motifs from the quinoline core (Fc1cc2ccc(...)nc2cc1F). The m/z 193 fragment could represent the quinoline moiety with an intact ethyl linker (C11H8F2N+), while m/z 179 may result from further loss of a methyl group (–CH2). The m/z 180 and 192 peaks likely correspond to isotopic contributions (e.g., 13C or 15N) or minor rearrangement fragments. Low-intensity peaks at m/z 106 and 107 are consistent with a benzyl ether-derived fragment (C7H7O+), where m/z 107 represents the intact cation and m/z 106 its dehydrogenated counterpart. Additional minor peaks at m/z 179 and 180 may reflect contributions from the fluorinated aromatic system. The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern highlights the stability of the quinoline ring and the susceptibility of the benzyl ether and ethyl linker to homolytic cleavage. The absence of significant peaks above m/z 376 confirms the molecular ion’s integrity, while the relative intensities of fragments provide insight into the molecule’s structural robustness under ionization. The presence of fluorine atoms is indirectly inferred through molecular weight confirmation and their influence on aromatic ring stability during fragmentation."

The spectrum exhibits a dominant molecular ion peak at m/z 252, corresponding to the intact molecular weight of the compound, confirming the molecular formula. Additional significant peaks are observed at m/z 223, 237, and 238, which likely represent fragment ions generated during ionization. The peak at m/z 223 suggests a loss of 29 Da, possibly attributable to the cleavage of a methoxy group (OCH3, 31 Da) followed by minor rearrangement or hydrogen loss. The peak at m/z 237 (loss of 15 Da) may arise from the elimination of a methyl group (CH3) or a hydrogen atom, while the peak at m/z 238 could indicate an isotope contribution (e.g., 13C) or a minor fragmentation pathway. A moderate peak at m/z 208 (loss of 44 Da) might correspond to the removal of a CO2 moiety or a similar neutral fragment. The peak at m/z 120 is consistent with a stable aromatic fragment, potentially derived from the benzene ring system in the structure. The low abundance of smaller m/z peaks suggests limited extensive fragmentation under the ionization conditions used. The spectrum’s pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the methoxy-substituted aromatic ring and the fused heterocyclic system, which likely stabilize certain fragmentation pathways. The presence of the molecular ion as the base peak (100% relative abundance) indicates the molecule’s relative stability during the ionization process, typical of electron ionization (EI) or electrospray ionization (ESI) methods. Overall, the spectral data corroborate the molecular formula and structural motifs defined by the SMILES notation."

The spectrum displays cross-peaks correlating directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei, providing insights into the molecule's structural features. The aliphatic region (¹H: 0–3 ppm; ¹³C: 20–60 ppm) shows multiple cross-peaks, consistent with the tert-butyl group (δH ~1.4 ppm, δC ~28 ppm) and the piperidine ring's methylene protons (δH ~1.6–3.0 ppm, δC ~25–50 ppm). These peaks reflect the Boc-protected amine and the saturated carbocyclic framework. In the aromatic region (¹H: 6–8.5 ppm; ¹³C: 110–150 ppm), distinct cross-peaks correspond to the pyridine and indoline substructures. The pyridine ring exhibits characteristic downfield proton shifts (δH ~7.2–8.5 ppm) with associated carbons (δC ~120–145 ppm), while the indoline moiety's aromatic protons appear slightly upfield (δH ~6.8–7.4 ppm) due to electron-donating effects of the adjacent nitrogen. The quaternary carbons of the pyridine (δC ~150–160 ppm) and indoline (δC ~140–150 ppm) are absent in the HSQC, as expected for non-protonated sites. Notably, the carbonyl carbon of the Boc group (δC ~155 ppm) lacks a corresponding proton signal, aligning with its quaternary nature. The spectrum's dispersion reflects the molecule's conformational rigidity, with minimal peak overlap. The absence of signals in the ¹H region below 0 ppm and above 14 ppm confirms no residual solvent or artifacts. Overall, the HSQC data corroborates the assigned structure, highlighting the spatial relationship between protons and carbons in both aliphatic and aromatic domains. This correlation aids in assigning specific resonances to the Boc group, piperidine, pyridine, and indoline components, validating the molecular framework."

The spectrum displays a molecular ion peak at m/z 446, corresponding to the intact molecule. A prominent peak at m/z 429 (14% relative abundance) suggests a loss of 17 Da, consistent with the elimination of an ammonia (NH₃) group from the molecular ion. The base peak at m/z 365 (100% relative abundance) indicates a highly stable fragment, likely arising from cleavage of the sulfonamide (–SO₂NH₂) group and adjacent aromatic ring, retaining the chlorophenyl and heterocyclic moieties. Additional significant peaks at m/z 330 (15%), 336 (18%), and 337 (20%) may correspond to further fragmentation of the heterocyclic core or aromatic rings. The presence of chlorine is corroborated by minor isotopic peaks at m/z 227 and 229 (3:1 ratio), reflecting the natural abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl in a fragment containing the chlorophenyl group. Peaks at m/z 201, 203, and 215 suggest smaller fragments derived from the heterocyclic ring system or aliphatic chain (–CCO–). The spectrum’s fragmentation pattern aligns with the structural features of the molecule, including the sulfonamide, chlorophenyl, and fused pyrimidine-oxazine rings, which undergo predictable bond cleavage under mass spectrometric conditions."

    "text": "This is a IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C19H18ClNO2 (SMILES: Cc1ccc2oc(/C=C/c3ccc(OCCCCl)cc3)nc2c1). The spectrum exhibits characteristic absorption bands corresponding to functional groups in the molecule. A prominent sharp peak at ~1000 cm⁻¹ suggests C-O stretching vibrations from the ether linkage in the OCCCCl侧链, while a moderate band near 1250 cm⁻¹ may correspond to C-N stretching in the benzoxazole ring. The region between 3000-2800 cm⁻¹ displays multiple weak absorptions attributable to aromatic and aliphatic C-H stretches, with the former appearing slightly sharper due to sp² hybridization. A distinct cluster of peaks around 1600-1500 cm⁻¹ reflects C=C stretching in the conjugated aromatic systems and the benzoxazole ring, with the most intense peak at ~1580 cm⁻¹ likely representing the extended π-system. The absence of broad O-H or N-H stretches above 3200 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of hydroxyl or amine groups, consistent with the molecular formula. Additional weak absorptions below 1000 cm⁻¹ may arise from C-Cl stretching vibrations (typically 700-500 cm⁻¹) and out-of-plane aromatic C-H deformations. The spectrum’s sharp, well-defined peaks indicate a rigid molecular structure with minimal hydrogen bonding, aligning with the compound’s aromatic and heterocyclic framework. This IR profile provides key insights into the molecule’s functional group composition and electronic environment."

    "text": "This is an IR spectrum of a molecule with formula C9H12N2O2 (SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccc(CNN)cc1). The spectrum exhibits several characteristic absorption bands that correlate with the functional groups present in this compound. The most prominent feature is a sharp, intense peak at approximately 1700 cm⁻¹, which corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the ester group. This is consistent with the presence of the COC(=O) moiety in the molecular structure. In the region between 3300-3500 cm⁻¹, multiple moderate-intensity peaks are observed, indicative of N-H stretching vibrations from the hydrazine (CNN) functional group. These peaks are slightly broader than typical O-H stretches, reflecting the hydrogen-bonding interactions of the hydrazine moiety. The aromatic C-H stretching vibrations appear as sharp, weak-to-moderate peaks between 3000-3100 cm⁻¹, confirming the presence of the benzene ring (c1ccccc1). Additional diagnostic features include a series of medium-intensity peaks in the 2800-3000 cm⁻¹ range, corresponding to the C-H stretching vibrations of the methyl (CH₃) group in the ester functionality. The fingerprint region (below 1500 cm⁻¹) contains multiple complex absorptions, including C-O stretching vibrations near 1250 cm⁻¹ and aromatic ring deformation modes between 1400-1600 cm⁻¹. Notably, the absence of a strong, broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of carboxylic acid functionality, consistent with the ester classification. The hydrazine group’s N-N single bond stretching vibration is not prominently visible, as it typically appears at lower wavenumbers (<1000 cm⁻¹), outside the primary focus of this spectrum. Overall, the spectral features align well with the proposed structure, with key absorptions confirming the ester, aromatic ring, and hydrazine substituents. The peak assignments provide a comprehensive overview of the molecule’s vibrational characteristics in the IR region."
