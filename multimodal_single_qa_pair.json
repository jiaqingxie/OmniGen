Combining this with the molecular formula C₃H₆O and SMILES notation CCC=O, the compound is identified as propanal (CH₃CH₂CHO). The spectrum reflects its structure: the aldehyde proton (singlet, 10 ppm), the CH₂ group (quartet, ~3 ppm), and the CH₃ group (triplet, ~1 ppm), though overlapping or simplified splitting may occur in this display."

For the compound with molecular formula C4H8O (SMILES: CC(C)=O), the spectrum shows three distinct cross-peaks. These correspond to the two equivalent methyl groups (CH3) attached to the carbonyl carbon (C=O) and the central carbonyl carbon itself. The downfield 13C shifts (~205 ppm) confirm the presence of a ketone group, while the upfield 1H shifts (~2.1 ppm) align with methyl protons adjacent to a carbonyl. This pattern is characteristic of acetone (propan-2-one), where symmetry simplifies the spectrum despite the molecular formula suggesting a four-carbon structure. The discrepancy in carbon count may indicate an error in the provided formula, as CC(C)=O corresponds to C3H6O. However, based on the given SMILES, the structure remains consistent with a ketone functional group and two methyl substituents."

The prominent peak near 70 ppm corresponds to a carbon attached to a hydroxyl group (C-OH), typical of a secondary alcohol. The peaks around 20-30 ppm represent aliphatic CH2 and CH3 groups. Combining this with the molecular formula C4H10O (SMILES: CCC(C)O), the compound is 2-butanol. The spectrum aligns with its structure, where the oxygen-bearing carbon (CH) appears downfield, and the remaining carbons (CH3, CH2, and CH3) produce the upfield signals."

The spectrum’s simplicity aligns with the symmetry in the molecule, where equivalent carbons produce fewer distinct peaks despite the C5H10O formula implying additional carbons. This discrepancy hints at a possible error in the formula, as CC(C)=O corresponds to C3H6O (acetone).

The broad peak near 3300 cm⁻¹ suggests an O-H stretch, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid group. Sharp peaks around 2900 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching in alkanes, while the strong absorption near 1700 cm⁻¹ points to a carbonyl group (C=O). The fingerprint region below 1500 cm⁻¹ shows complex vibrations typical of aromatic or substituted ring structures. These features align with the molecular formula provided."

Additional peaks between 10-50 ppm suggest aliphatic carbons, likely from the methyl (CH3) and methylene (CH2) groups in the branched alkyl chain. The absence of signals above 100 ppm confirms there are no aromatic or sp2-hybridized carbons beyond the carbonyl. This aligns with the structure of 4-methyl-2-pentanone, where the carbonyl is flanked by a branched carbon framework."
