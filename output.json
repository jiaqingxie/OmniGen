    "question": "Analyze the molecular structure of C14H12O2 (SMILES: C1=CC=C(C=C1)COC(=O)C2=CC=CC=C2). What are the key spectroscopic features that would help identify this compound?",
    "solution": "To identify C14H12O2 (SMILES: C1=CC=C(C=C1)COC(=O)C2=CC=CC=C2), we would look for several key spectroscopic features:\n\n1. IR Spectrum: Look for characteristic absorption bands corresponding to functional groups\n2. NMR Spectrum: Analyze chemical shifts and coupling patterns\n3. Mass Spectrum: Identify molecular ion peak and fragmentation patterns\n4. Cross-reference: Compare with known spectra and databases",
    "internvl3_thinking_trajectories": "Let me think through this step by step. For C14H12O2, I need to consider:\n1. The molecular structure from SMILES: C1=CC=C(C=C1)COC(=O)C2=CC=CC=C2\n2. Expected functional groups and their spectroscopic signatures\n3. How different analytical techniques complement each other\n4. Systematic approach to compound identification",
    "internvl3_attempt": "Based on my analysis, C14H12O2 would show characteristic peaks in IR around 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O stretch), NMR signals around 2-4 ppm, and a molecular ion at m/z corresponding to the molecular weight. The fragmentation pattern would help confirm the structure."
